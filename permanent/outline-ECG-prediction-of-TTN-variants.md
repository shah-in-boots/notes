# Introduction

## Background

- Most common sustained arrhythmia in adults
- ~40% develop AF after age of 55 years [@Michaud2021]
- Risk factors include: age, CAD, male sex, European ancestry, hypertension, obesity, smoking, sleep apnea, family history of AF in relatives
- Approximately 3% of AF before age of 60 have suspected monogenic basis [@Chalazan2023]


## Relationship to ECG

- @Chaudhari2023 looked at ECG predictors of myocardial ischemia/injury
- @Verweij2020 shows markers on the ECG associated with genetic variants from the UK Biobank
- ECG can supplement genetic and clinical factors to predict risk of AF, such as work by @Wang2023
- @vandeLeur2021 identifies ECG features that mark certain genetic arrhythmic conditions, such as phospholambdan mutants
- @Tereshchenko2018 looked at GWAS for patients with abnormalities in GEH
- @Kerr2017 looked at heart rate variability and genetic variants

## Substrate phenotypes

AF arrhythmogenesis is predicated on:
1. Afterdepolarization-based triggered events
1. Areas of automaticity in the atria
1. Atrial tissue that can maintain and sustain re-entry (driven by the above)

## Proposal

# Methods

## Cohort description

## Electrocardiography

## Genetic variants

## Machine learning approach

@Siontis2021 notes that artificial intelligence methods can be used in CVD risk prediction.
@vandeLeur2021 describes the methodology of using deep neural networks.
We will evaluate the relationship of TTN loss-of-function (LOF) genes and atrial fibrillation risk in a sample of individuals with WES. 

@Selvaraju2020 describes the Grad-CAM approach.

# Results

# Discussion

## Limitations

There are pitfalls in the usage of "big data" approaches, particularly with external validity, as described by @vandeLeur2020

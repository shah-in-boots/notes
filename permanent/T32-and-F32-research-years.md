In 2026, I will likely submit my K23 application. 
In it, I will have to specify project aims. My areas of research interest are in the following:

- signal processing of ECG and EGM data
- machine learning for ECG-informed risk prediction
- genetics and epigenetics of atrial fibrillation
- stress reactivity and heart rate variability

In preparation, I am developing research towards this work. 
This includes publications and preliminary data.  
During this research time, some products have been:

- Atrial Flutter and Family History 
- Paper on how AF burden and treatment strategies lead to different quality of life changes based on social factors, as in [AFEQT-and-social-determinants-of-health-overview](AFEQT-and-social-determinants-of-health-overview.md)
- Project in collaboration with the AFGen Consortium on predicting TTN variants based on ECG  features

I need to break apart my __BHAG__ into a overarching hypothesis that leads me towards it, as it needs to be a small enough project that can be tested and finished within 5 years (at 50% protected time).
This is described in [K23](K23.md).
The hypothesis then needs to be approached using 3-4 specific aims, building on my skills and prior research.

- Signal processing: ECG and EGM data
- Biostatistics: statistical analyses, recurrent events
- Harmonic regression: cosinor analysis
- Computational genetics: Ensembl-VEP software, rare variant analysis
- Coding/programming: R, MATLAB, Python
- Electrophysiology procedures: animal and human studies, access to specific EP data

My overall interest is in using the K23 to explore how research can be performed in the EP lab, while also advancing my skills in epidemiology, signal processing, and genetics. 
The most important element is that the proposal must be novel, innovative, and *worth* investing in from a research perspective.
These aims need to be related but independent, and will use atrial fibrillation as the model disease. 
They need to reflect expertise from the institution/primary mentors & sponsors.

The areas of expertise of the mentorship group and institutions revolve around the following:

- Mental stress and autonomic dysfunction with [Amit-J-Shah-MD-MS](Amit-J-Shah-MD-MS.md) at Emory
- Genetic data and whole exome sequencing with [Yan-Sun-PhD](Yan-Sun-PhD.md) at Emory
- Atrial fibrillation modeling using MRI and EPS with [Ravi-Ranjan-MD-PhD](Ravi-Ranjan-MD-PhD.md) and [Robert-MacLeod-PhD](Robert-MacLeod-PhD.md) at Utah
- AF genetics and translational work with [Dawood-Darbar-MD-MBChB](Dawood-Darbar-MD-MBChB.md) at UIC

# Versions of Aims

The aims are oriented around different topics, methodologies, and datasets that may be available. 
There looks to be three major themes here that *pull together* my aims - there is a __mapping__ oriented aim in the EP lab, a __ECG__ based aim looking at phenotypic differences based on genetics (and null variants), and an exploratory aim on __novel variants__. 
Below I go over potential working titles and conceptual aim ideas, which are then expanded in the subsequently

## v0.0.1

*Substrate and Ion Channel-Mediated Phenotypes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation*  
*Tissue and Ion Channel-Mediated Phenotypes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation*
1. (A) substrate phenotyping based on LGE patterns on CMR; (B) EP lab evaluation of properties of substrate in "trigger" conditions
1. Substrate by genotypes on ECG in UIC and Utah datasets.
1. Novel variants that are stress-related with Emory data.

## v0.0.2

*Autonomic-Mediation of Atrial Fibrillation Pathways*  
*Drivers of Triggered Episodes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation*  
*Contextualized Substrate-Based Phenotypes in Atrial Fibrillation*
1. Substrate-mapping using CMR and phenotyping areas of LGE pattern.
1. EP lab based evaluation of scar-interaction with different vagal maneuvers for propagation of AF
1. Creation of novel prediction maps for AF and arrhythmia pathways

## v0.0.3 

*Genetic and Epigenetic Interactions with Substrate-Based Phenotypes of Atrial Fibrillation*  
*Substrate-Based Evolution of Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes*  
1. Phenotype substrates of AF based on LGE/EPS scar models from Utah, with ECG-based reference/training. Explore EPS relationship with scar-burden modulation by context (pacing rate, vagal maneuvers, vagolysis).
1. Evolution of ECG-based phenotypes in *mutants* and *wild-types* of AF using WES/WGS datasets. Assess relationship of ECG-findings with amount of expected change based on genetic variants.
1. Evaluation of rare/novel variants of AF using mendelian randomization of stress-related disorders associated with AF. 

## v0.1.0

Title: Substrate-Based Phenotypes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
1. __Substrated-based phenotypes of AF: (A) CMR burden of LGE, EAM scar, and ECG phenotyping of AF. (B) EPS-based phenotyping of scar, and scar-responsiveness to triggering events in APD heterogeneity. E.g. what does scar look like, and how does scar respond to initiate arrhythmia in the atria?__ Regions of scar seen on MRI/EAM are areas that may lead to the initiation and maintaenance of AF. Can evaluate these areas to look for repolarization abnormalities and characteristics associated with AF onset and maintenance. Can try to evaluate APD heterogeneity in AF at boundaries of scar in different conditions.  Apply these findings to MRI-based maps to consider AF prediction (modeling of AF). Future studies can look at how MRI can be used to predict AF episodes and future burden. Will model the effect of action potential duration heterogeneity at scar borders with AF episode maintenance. Prospective approach to mapping in EP lab. Study monophasic action potentials in paroxysmal AF cases undergoing ablation. Evaluate under influence of isoproterenol $\pm$ atropine $\pm$ vagal stimulation. Why? Assess repolarization abnormalities and affect of stress/triggers on AF threshold. 
1. __Sarcomeric and Ion-Channel Based ECG phenotypes of AF: *Wild-type* and *mutant* ECG patterns of paroxysmal AF. Relationship of monogenic variants in AF with changes in substrate pathology and ion channel remodeling in categorization AF subtypes.__ Can evaluate the ECG-based association with specific "substrate" genes and "ion channel" genes, and "wild-type" AF. See if ECG patterns can categorize patients utilizing UIC dataset, and UK Biobank.  This extends the [ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants](ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants.md) project. May also validate using *All of Us* dataset.
1. __Identify novel/rare variants associated with AF (Exploratory Aim): Mendelian randomization of triggered arrhythmias approach focusing on high-risk/high-stress conditions (PTSD, anxiety, reduced stress-induced HRV reactivity).__ Look at Emory HRV stress reactivity data, and evaluate association with common/rare variants in GWAS data. Then, test association of these rare variants with future arrhythmia risk (both in local Emory data) and in UK Biobank. 

## v0.1.1

Title: Substrate-based Trajectory of Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes
1. Quantify dynamic atrial conduction properties in scar-based AF.
1. Compare the ECG-based substrates and their evolution in monogenic mutants for AF.
1. Identify novel, stress-related variants and their impact on AF risk.

## v0.1.2

Title: Genetic Interaction with Substrate-Based Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes  
Bottom Line: If we know how AF phenotypes evolve, we can understand and target/tailor therapies based on underlying trajectories.
1. Substrate phenotyping (with outcomes)
1. Scar interaction with contextual triggers
1. Triggering states with genetic risk of AT/AF

## v0.1.3

__Genetic Interaction with Substrate-Based Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes__  
*The underlying drivers of atrial fibrillation likely evolve along the pathways of Coumel's triangle (triggers -> substrate). This work tells us how AF evolves, and how different structural and ion-channel changes contribute, to be able to identify and understand disease progression.*
1. Classify AF phenotypes and their trajectories (A) based on markers of scar/fibrosis found on MRI/EPS, and (B) based on genetic variants that are causal for AF, based on structural/ion-channel mutations.
1. Evaluate the effect of AF thresholds based on scar burden in EP studies prior to PVI, utilizing differential autonomic contexts, including vagal stimulation, vagolysis, and sympathetic stimulation.
1. __Exploratory:__ Evaluate the role of common and rare variants in stress-related disorders (abnormal response to acute and chronic stress) with future arrhythmia risk using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach.

Feedback...
- This doesn't seem like it comes together very well as an overall project however. It needs more sup
- Needs to be more inline with research done at Utah (e.g. EP lab/mapping aim, scar-mediation) and previous resources (AF genetics and stress/autonomic function)

## v0.1.4

__Dynamicity in Substrate-Based Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes__   
*Identify the interaction between substrate and context lead to more accurate prediction of arrhythmia type and progression. If AF can be more accurately phenotyped, then future risk can be better mitigated.*
1. Phenotype AF based on scar properties and scar contribution. Evaluate genetic contribution.
1. Assess intracardiac and MRI-based AF dynamics in context with EP studies. Evaluate in stress-related conditions (e.g. PTSD).
1. Identify novel variants for AF risk in MR-based study

## v0.1.5

__Contextual Evolution of Substrate-Based Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes__  
*By understanding how the multifactorial substrate for AF is modulated by context, we can better understand the risk for AF arrhythmogenesis and potential tailor treatment strategies.*
1. Generate ECG-based phenotypes of AF based on (A) patterns of scar/fibrosis generated by EPS and CMR/LGE and (B) rare/common variants that are associated with AF. 
1. Identify differences in APD heterogeneity by scar-burden in context of modulated autonomic outflow.
1. Identify novel rare variants for AF in diseases/states that are associated with altered autonomic tone, including PTSD, abnormal HRV, etc. Utilize mendelian randomizatino approach.

Feedback from Ravi Ranjan...
- The ECG phenotypes from aim 1 need to be written in such a way that PVI (the mainstay) is not thrown out or goes against dogma (e.g. paroxysmal without myopathy needs PVI, regardless of ECG characteristics)
- The second aim requires understanding how to measure APD effectively
- The third aim is not cohesive with the others

## v0.2.0

At this point, have decided that the aims may be disparate enough that two different applications are likely more conducive - one through a VA-CDA and another through the NIH-K23 mechanism.
[Amit-J-Shah-MD-MS](Amit-J-Shah-MD-MS.md) however suggested a way to unify the aims more clearly, under the auspice of stress and arrhythmias.

1. EPS to evaluate measures of how a "mental stress cocktail" can help evaluate the properties of atrial tissue and islands of cholinergic neurons. 
	- Build a cohort to identify features of "atrial resilience" to arrhythmia (particularly AF). 
	- Obtain bloodwork to help measure autonomic responses and whole genome sequencing data to create polygenic risk
1. Apply autonomic variables to algorithm in computational geometry maps that predict arrhythmia. Use weights of variables based off of (1) to help with prediction. Compare those to future EP studies with multiple arrhythmias that are found.
1. Evaluate association of polygenic risk score for chronic stress disorders (e.g. PTSD, depression, anxiety) with cohort of 50-100 individuals undergoing EP study. 
	- Identify the "difficulty" in inducing arrhythmia and rank PGS against that to identify "susceptible" and "resiliency" SNPs. 
	- Obtain additional SNPs using abnormal HRV response from mental stress cohort from Emory
	- Perform Mendelian Randomization using those SNPs in UK Biobank

# Data 

## UIC

- Collected 800k ECG of patients with AF, along with clinical histories, burden, medication changes
- Collected ~600 genomes of patients with AF of various comorbidity burdens
- Working on research to help identify phenotypes of AF, and understand trajectory/progression of AF

## Emory

## Utah



## UK Biobank

**Electrophysiology Study**

-   Baseline and post-procedural atrial conduction properties
-   Coronary sinus + circulating blood samples (including DNA)
-   Surface + intracardiac mapping and electrophysiological signal
-   Vagal nerve stimulation

**Big Data**

-   Cohort generated from population-level data (UIC/CCTS, ARIC, MVP/VAMC)
-   Computational model to classify AF based on clinical + cardiac imaging features
-   Whole exome sequencing of DNA in pAF patients to identify autonomic variants
-   Extraction of intracardiac features from EPS (volume, scar, voltage, etc...)

__ECG markers__:

- HF HRV
- "Coarse" AF based on F-wave amplitude
- P-wave morphology (dispersion, variability, terminal forces, summation)
- Electrical heterogeneity

__TTE markers__:

- LA size
- Diastology
- LVEF
- LVIDD

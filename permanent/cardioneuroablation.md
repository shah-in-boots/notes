The basic physiology behind cardioneurablation involves the ganglionated plexi and how the interact with cardiac tissue, particularly atrial tissue.

@Pachon2023 reviews the current status of cardioneuroablation in 2023, but with a focus on its role in bradycardia and vasovagal syncope. See [Pachon2023](../literature/Pachon2023.md) for article annotations and figures.

- VNS may be anti-arrhythmic in animal models, with decreased VT/VF, but minimal human studies
	- GANGLIA-AF, paroxysmal AF randomized to PVI or atrial GP ablation, decreased AAD dosages in GP group, n = 102

# Ablation

Pulse field ablation (**PFA**) may not directly impact the ganglionated plexi. 
- @Guo2023 notes no signs of nerve damage to the GP systems with PFA, with no changes in serum biomarkers $S100 \beta$ or other neurofilaments such as glial fibrillary acidic protein ($GFAP$) or brain fatty acid-binding protein ($B-FABP$), nor changes in HRV
- @Lemoine2024 looked at PVI using PFA versus cryoballoon (**CBA**) and found that there were higher heart rates in CBA and decreased HRV, with similar recurrence rates of AF within x1 year. This group also found similar rates of recurrence regardless of $S100\beta$ levels

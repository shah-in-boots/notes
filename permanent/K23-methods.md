# Mapping dynamic fibrillatory area

AF cases have some level of recurrence
Recurrence may be due to fibrillatory area remaining
Dynamic atrial properties may lead to this recurrence
Can map APD using ARI (activation recovery interval)
However ARI limited by variability due to hard to create reference
Better for ventricular signal
But, ATA (area under the repolarization curve) matches dynamic APD changes
Surrogate for APD changes to different "stressors"

Isoproterenol washout protocol could be used
See difference in EAM scar and "dormant" tissue
Also see changes in ATA and ARI (as surrogates for APD alternans)
May predict recurrence rates from non PV triggers

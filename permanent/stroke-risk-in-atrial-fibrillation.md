Stroke risk can be broken down into several categories:

1. Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation, due to LAA thrombus 
2. Stroke risk in atrial fibrillation, due to valvular or atrial conditions, such as rheumatic heart disease. 
3. Stroke risk upon electrical cardioversion due to change in rhythm, including the acute and post-acute atrial functional changes.
4. Stroke risk on anticoagulation, which is different based on type of anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin versus DOAC). 
5. Stroke risk with left atrial appendage occlusion (clip or plug systems). 


# Baseline risk

| Category | Absolute Risk |
| --- | --- |
| Low | <1%/year |
| Intermediate | 1-2%/year |
| High | >2%.year |

Calculations of risk are limited  because they can overestimate and underestimate risk based on criteria that may or may not be included [@Joglar2024].
Some scoring systems include:

- $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc$ score
- $ATRIA$ score (Anticoagluation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation)
- $GARFIELD-AF$ (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field - Atrial Fibrillation)

Limitations of the se scoring systems however are that certain risk factors are not accounted for, such as type of AF, burden of AF, smoking, obesity, cardiac structural abnormalities, kidney disease.

The key trials that suggest that anticoagulation is beneficial are relatively old, which is why it is standard of practice. 
They go along with the timeline of CVA prophylaxis in AF.
- SPAF trial, by @SPAFInvestigators1991, looked at warfarin versus placebo, and was very effective
- RELY, by @Connolly2009, compared dabigatran to warfarin, and found DOAC to be superior
- ARISTOTLE, by @Granger2011, compared apixaban to warfarin and found DOAC to be superior as well
- ROCKET-AF, by @Patel2011, compared rivaroxaban versus warfarin, and similarly found it to be superior
- ENGAGE-AF, by @Giugliano2013, compared edoxaban to warfarin, and was non-inferior
- Stroke risk after giving anticoagulation is roughly 50-70% lower than at baseline, with rates of usually in 1-2%

# Left atrial appendage occlusion

Key trials looked at percutaneous occlusion systems and future CVA risk, particularly as comparison to OAC...
 - ASAP study, by @Holmes2009, comparing ASA and clopidogrel with LAAO, looked at how well patients who were ineligble for OAC would do with DAPT. It showed reduced risk from about 7% based on $CHADS_{2}$ score
 - EWOLUTION trial, by @Turagam2019, looked at Watchman procedural success even when majority did not use OAC in the peri-procedural time period
 - PINNACLE FLX, by @Kar2021, looked at the Watchman FLX device and procedural complications
 - PROTECT AF, by @Reddy2014, was a RCT that looked at Watchman versus warfarin, and was non-inferior but had fewer CV mortality and all-cause mortality events
 - PREVAIL, by @Holmes2014, was an RCT that did not show inferiority to warfarin, with unexpectedly low event rates
 - PRAGUE-17, by @Osmancik2020, was an RCT that compared LAAO to DOACs in a high risk cohort ($CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc \approx 5$), with non-inferiority of LAAO, however 5% complication of procedure risk

Alternatives to percutaneous closure were surgical closure, through multiple methods. Key articles include...
- LAAOS III, by XXX, an RCT that looked at those undergoing cardiac surgery with pre-existing AF. Trial showed that there was a decreased thromboembolism burden, further reduced with OAC therapy. 

# Device complications

Peridevice leaks (**PDL**) are relatively common after LAAO.
For the first generation of devices, e.g. Watchman, the PDL risk within the first year was between 30-40%.
The second generation, Watchman FLX, was about 15-20% risk. 
PDL are categorized by size, with <3 mm to <5 mm considered as small.
PDL that 1/4 patients had PDL at 1 year, which increased the risk for ischemic stroke by ~2, studied in the NCDR LAAO Registry by @Alkhouli2023 and the PROTECT-AF follow-up data by @Dukkipati2022

Overall, the residual stroke risk remains elevated but not as high as without anticoagulation, partially because of device-related thrombus (**DRT**).
The stroke risk from PROTECT-AF [@Reddy2014] and PREVAIL [@Holmes2014] remains elevated to about 2-3% in the high risk populations, which is lower than their untreated or un-anticoagulated risk range.
The risk of device-related thrombus is not trivial.  
In the PROTECT-AF, PREVAIL, and CAP registries, the DRT risk was approximately 4%, which extended out up to 2 years. 
The consequence was an increase in CVA or thromboembolism, roughly increased 3-to-5 fold risk (and 7-fold risk of hemorrhagic stroke due to reinitiation of OAC) [@Dukkipati2018; @Alkhouli2018].
Contrary information seen in the EWOLUTION registry, with no real increased risk of TIA/CVA events [@Turagam2019].

# Ablation and LAAO

@Du2024 showed that in a combination procedure of both ablation with PVI and LAAO implant, the risk of future AF and incidence of PDL and DRT was lower if the LAAO device was implanted first, which may be from better seating of the device because there is no pre-existing edema - COMBINATION trial.
However this is with RF energy and not PFA, meaning the edema burden is different. 

@Wazni2024 performed the OPTION trial. 
They looked at LAAO after ablation with PVI, as an alternative to OAC therapy. 
800 patients were evaluated, with mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc$ was about 3.5. 
At 3 years, there were fewer events in teh LAAO group than the OAC group, suggesting non-inferiority and potential decreased bleeding events. 

@Preisendorfer2024 looked at a propensity-matched analysis in JCE.
A smaller study, but showed similar rates of initial complications, with approximately a 2 hour increase in procedure time with LAAO. 
Mean $CHA_{2}DS_{2}VASc$ was about 4.2 in about 210 patients.

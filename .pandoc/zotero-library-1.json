Improvements in valve design, valve deployment technologies, preprocedural imaging and increased operator experience have led to a gradual decline in length of hospitalisation after TAVR. Despite these advances, the need for permanent pacemaker implantation for post-TAVR high-degree atrioventricular block (HAVB) has persisted and has well-established risk factors which can be used to identify patients who are at high risk and advise them accordingly. While most HAVB occurs within 48 hours of the procedure, there is a growing number of patients developing HAVB after initial hospitalisation for TAVR due to the trend for early discharge from hospital. Several observation and management strategies have been proposed. This article reviews major known risk factors for HAVB after TAVR, discusses trends in the timing of HAVB after TAVR and reviews some management strategies for observing transient HAVB after TAVR.</p>","author":[{"family":"Mazzella","given":"Anthony J"},{"family":"Arora","given":"Sameer"},{"family":"Hendrickson","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Mason"},{"family":"Vavalle","given":"John P"},{"family":"Gehi","given":"Anil K"}],"citation-key":"@Mazzella2021","container-title":"Cardiac Failure Review","DOI":"10.15420/cfr.2021.05","ISSN":"20577559","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,27]]},"title":"Evaluation and Management of Heart Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Patients with multiple pregnancies or >37 weeks gestation or not sure of dates or fetal distress or vaginal bleeding or preterm labor or chorioamnionitis were excluded from this study. The diagnosis of PROM was based on patient's history of sudden gush of water, pooling of amniotic fluid, positive ferning pattern, positive nitrazine test, confirmed by visualization of fluid passing from the cervical canal during sterile speculum examination and Trans-abdominal ultrasound to measure the amniotic fluid index (AFI ≤ 5 cm in PROM). The gestational age was calculate from the first day of LMP and confirmed by early ultrasound scan (done before 20 weeks gestation). Patients included in this study were subjected to standard examination, trans-abdominal ultrasound and sterile speculum examination to detect amniotic fluid pooling through the cervical canal and for collection of samples on admission. Some laboratory investigations were done to exclude chorioamnionitis (maternal fever, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, maternal leucocytosis, CRP).\nRESULTS: In this study, the sensitivity and the specificity of fetal fibronectin in diagnosing PROM were 94.5 and 89.1 %, respectively, as compared with 84.5 % sensitivity and 78.2 % specificity for Ferning test, respectively, and 87.3 % sensitivity and 80.9 % specificity for Nitrazine test, respectively. The PPV and NPV of fetal fibronectin were 89.7 and 94.2 %, respectively, as compared with 79.5 % PPV and 83.5 % NPV for Ferning test, respectively, and 82.1 % PPV and 86.4 % NPV for Nitrazine test, respectively. Fetal fibronectin was more accurate (91.8 %) for detection of PROM than Ferning (81.4 %) or Nitrazine (84.1 %) tests.\nCONCLUSION: The Quick Check fFN test(®) for detection of the fetal fibronectin in the vaginal fluid is a simple bedside test, more sensitive, and specific than Ferning and Nitrazine tests, it can be used as complimentary test to confirm the clinical diagnosis of premature rupture of fetal membranes.","author":[{"family":"Abdelazim","given":"Ibrahim A."}],"citation-key":"abdelazim2013","container-title":"Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics","container-title-short":"Arch.

  {"id":"Abdullah2018","abstract":"Background: The associations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease mortality in an exclusively low estimated 10-year risk group are not well delineated. We sought to determine the long-term associations of various LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) thresholds and CVD and coronary heart disease mortality in a large, low 10-year risk cohort. Methods: The study sample included participants of the CCLS (Cooper Center Longitudinal Study) without a history of CVD or diabetes mellitus and defined as low risk (<7.5%) for 10-year atherosclerotic CVD events at baseline based on Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. The associations of fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality were tested with Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In 36 375 participants (72% men, median age 42) followed for a median of 26.8 years, 1086 CVD and 598 coronary heart disease deaths occurred. Compared with LDL-C <100 mg/dL, LDL-C categories 100 to 129 mg/dL, 130 to 159 mg/dL, 160 to 189.9 mg/dL, and ≥190 mg/dL were associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.7), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.4), and 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.3), and mean reductions in years free of CVD death of 1.8, 1.1, 4.3, and 3.9, respectively. After adjustment for atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, LDL-C categories 160 to 189 mg/dL and ≥190 mg/dL remained independently associated with CVD mortality, with hazard ratios of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.2) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-2.1), respectively. In multivariable-adjusted models using non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL as the reference, non-HDL-C 160 to 189 mg/dL, 190 to 219 mg/dL, and ≥220 mg/dL were significantly associated with CVD death, with hazard ratios of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.8 (95% CI, 1.4-2.2), and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-2.0), respectively. Restricting the cohort to those with 10-year risk <5% did not diminish the associations of LDL-C and non-HDL-C with CVD mortality. Conclusions: In a low 10-year risk cohort with long-term follow-up, LDL-C and non-HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL were independently associated with a 50% to 80% increased relative risk of CVD mortality. These findings may have implications for future cholesterol treatment paradigms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdullah","given":"Shuaib M."},{"family":"Defina","given":"Laura F."},{"family":"Leonard","given":"David"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Carolyn E."},{"family":"Radford","given":"Nina B."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Rohatgi","given":"Anand"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"Darren K."},{"family":"De Lemos","given":"James A."},{"family":"Grundy","given":"Scott M."},{"family":"Berry","given":"Jarett D."},{"family":"Khera","given":"Amit"}],"citation-key":"Abdullah2018","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034273","ISSN":"15244539","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,20]]},"page":"2315-2325","PMID":"30571575","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Long-Term Association of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol with Cardiovascular Mortality in Individuals at Low 10-Year Risk of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Results from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30571575/","volume":"138"},
  {"id":"Abe1997","abstract":"Adenosine plays an important role in postischemic dysfunction of cardiac sympathetic nerves because exogenously infused adenosine produces and adenosine deaminase prevents \"neural stunning.\" We examined whether adenosine acts via a specific receptor mechanism to produce neural stunning. Anesthetized dogs were treated with propranolol to attenuate increases in coronary flow due to adrenergic stimulation of myocardial metabolism. A 15-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) attenuated subsequent LAD coronary vasoconstriction to bilateral sympathetic stimulation during reperfusion by 75% (P < 0.05). Coronary infusion of the adenosine-receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (nonspecific), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (A1 specific), or 3,7-dimethyl-1-propagylxanthine (A2 specific) during LAD occlusion prevented the attenuation of sympathetic coronary constriction. In separate experiments, either the specific adenosine agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (A1 specific) or CGS-21680 (A2 specific) or a combination of both agonists was infused into the LAD for 15 min. Neither agonist alone attenuated subsequent sympathetic coronary constriction. In contrast, 15 min after the combined administration of both agonists, sympathetic vasoconstriction was reduced. We conclude that adenosine is capable of attenuating neurogenic coronary constriction through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Activation of more than one receptor subtype is necessary to produce neural stunning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abe","given":"T."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"D.

  {"id":"Abe1997b","abstract":"Thirty-two consecutive patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, with previously defined mechanisms of the tachycardias, were interviewed by noninvestigators about whether they experienced symptoms of diuresis during or at the termination of the tachycardias, to test the hypothesis that patients with A V nodal reentrant tachycardia would have a feeling of diuresis, polyuria, or both during or at the termination of the tachycardia. Twelve of the 13 patients with A V nodal reentrant tachycardia (92%), two of the 15 patients with A V reentrant tachycardia (13%), and one of the 4 patients with atrial flutter associated with 2:1 AV conduction (25%) felt diuresis during or at the termination of the tachycardias (A V nodal reentrant tachycardia vs other forms of tachycardia; P < 0.001). In 14 of the 32 patients, the right atrial pressure and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration were measured during both the tachycardias and sinus rhythm. The mean right atrial pressure during A V nodal reentrant tachycardia was significantly elevated compared to that during other forms of tachycardia (P < 1.01). The plasma ANP concentration during A V nodal reentrant tachycardia was also elevated significantly compared to that during other forms of tachycardias (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the cycle lengths of the tachycardias, age, left atrial dimensions, or the left ventricular ejection fraction between the A V nodal reentrant tachycardia and the other forms of tachycardia. We concluded that the feeling of diuresis during or at the termination of tachycardia was a more common symptom in patients with A V nodal reentrant tachycardia. The higher secretion of plasma ANP from the right atrium might be involved in the mechanism of this symptom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Abe","given":"Haruhiko"},{"family":"Nagatomo","given":"Toshihisa"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Hideyuki"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Masaru Araki","given":"Akio Kuroiwa"},{"family":"Nakashima","given":"Yasuhide"}],"citation-key":"Abe1997b","container-title":"PACE - Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8159.1997.tb05436.x","ISSN":"01478389","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"2783-2788","PMID":"9392809","publisher":"Pacing Clin Electrophysiol","title":"Neurohumoral and hemodynamic mechanisms of diuresis during atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9392809/","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"Abisse2011","abstract":"Introduction: Changes in the autonomic nervous system activity are a major trigger of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTAs). Mental arithmetic, a condition administered in a laboratory setting, can provide insight into the autonomic nervous system activity effects on cardiac physiology. We examined the responses of cardiac repolarization to laboratory-induced psychological stressors in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with the objective of identifying the indices that differentiate patients with and without subsequent VTA in follow-up.\nMethods: Continuous electrocardiographic signals were recorded using 3 standard bipolar (Holter) leads in 56 patients (age, 63.6 ± 11.9; female, 12%; left ventricular ejection fraction, 32.3 ± 11) with ICDs during mental arithmetic. The patients were separated into those with subsequent VTA during 3 to 4 years of follow-up (group 1: n = 9) and those without VTA (group 2: n = 47). Changes in repolarization (QT interval, mean T wave amplitude [Tamp], and T wave area) were analyzed during 5 minutes at baseline, stress, and recovery. The temporal instability of Tamp and T wave area was examined using the range (Δ) and variance (σ2) of beat-to-beat variations of the corresponding parameters.\nResults: There were no significant differences in heart rate between the 2 groups at baseline (61 vs 63 beats per minute, P = .97), stress (64 vs 65 beats per minute, P = .40), and recovery (62 vs 61 beats per minute, P = .88). However, during mental stress and poststress recovery, ΔTamp was almost 2-fold greater in group 1 compared with group 2 (111 [57-203] vs 68 [44-94] μV, P = .04, respectively). Changes in QT intervals were also greater in group 1 compared with group 2 (P = .02).\nConclusion: Among patients with ICDs, changes of Tamp after psychological stress were greater in those with subsequent arrhythmic events. This might signal proarrhythmic repolarization response and help identify patients who would benefit the most from ICD implantation and proactive management. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"Abriel2015","abstract":"The movement of ions across specific channels embedded on the membrane of individual cardiomyocytes is crucial for the generation and propagation of the cardiac electric impulse. Emerging evidence over the past 20 years strongly suggests that the normal electric function of the heart is the result of dynamic interactions of membrane ion channels working in an orchestrated fashion as part of complex molecular networks. Such networks work together with exquisite temporal precision to generate each action potential and contraction. Macromolecular complexes play crucial roles in transcription, translation, oligomerization, trafficking, membrane retention, glycosylation, post-translational modification, turnover, function, and degradation of all cardiac ion channels known to date. In addition, the accurate timing of each cardiac beat and contraction demands, a comparable precision on the assembly and organizations of sodium, calcium, and potassium channel complexes within specific subcellular microdomains, where physical proximity allows for prompt and efficient interaction. This review article, part of the Compendium on Sudden Cardiac Death, discusses the major issues related to the role of ion channel macromolecular assemblies in normal cardiac electric function and the mechanisms of arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. It provides an idea of how these issues are being addressed in the laboratory and in the clinic, which important questions remain unanswered, and what future research will be needed to improve knowledge and advance therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Abriel","given":"Hugues"},{"family":"Rougier","given":"Jean Sébastien"},{"family":"Jalife","given":"José"}],"citation-key":"Abriel2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305017","ISBN":"0009-7330","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"1971-1988","PMID":"26044251","title":"Ion Channel Macromolecular Complexes in Cardiomyocytes: Roles in Sudden Cardiac Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.305017","volume":"116"},

We evaluated the impact of cumulative SDOH burden on cardiovascular risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, and incident cardiovascular disease events.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nWe included 6479 participants from the MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). A weighted aggregate SDOH score representing the cumulative number of unfavorable SDOHs, identified from 14 components across 5 domains (economic stability, neighborhood and physical environment, community and social context, education, and health care system access) was calculated and divided into quartiles (quartile 4 being the least favorable). The impact of cumulative SDOH burden on cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity), systemic inflammation, subclinical atherosclerosis, and incident cardiovascular disease was evaluated. Increasing social disadvantage was associated with increased odds of all cardiovascular risk factors except dyslipidemia. Smoking was the risk factor most strongly associated with worse SDOH (odds ratio [OR], 2.67 for quartile 4 versus quartile 1 [95% CI, 2.13–3.34]). Participants within SDOH quartile 4 had 33% higher odds of increased high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.11–1.60]) and 31% higher risk of all cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03–1.67]), yet no greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.79–1.29]), when compared with those in quartile 1.\n\nConclusions\n\nIncreasing social disadvantage was associated with more prevalent cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, and incident cardiovascular disease.

A retrospective analysis was performed on patients (n = 567) with a diagnosis of HE admitted to two tertiary care centers that primarily serve an inner-city population. Data on demographics, clinical variables, and cTnI were collected through chart review. Using regression analyses, predictors of cTnI elevation were studied and the impact of cTnI on all-cause mortality (data obtained through the Social Security Death Index) was determined. cTnI elevation was observed in 186 (32.3%) admissions with a mean peak cTnI level of 4.06 ± 14.6 ng/mL. Predictors of cTnI were age, history of hypercholesterolemia, blood urea nitrogen level, pulmonary edema, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. During a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years, there were 211 deaths (37%). Neither the presence nor the extent of cTnI elevation was associated with mortality, while age, history of coronary artery disease, and blood urea nitrogen level were predictive of mortality. cTnI elevation commonly occurs in the setting of HEs.

  {"id":"Agarwal2017","abstract":"Background Cardiac autonomic perturbations frequently antecede onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Interventions that influence autonomic inputs to myocardium may prevent AF. However, whether low heart rate or heart rate variability (HRV), which are noninvasive measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, are associated with AF incidence is unclear. Objectives This study sought to study the association between HRV and risk of AF. Methods This study included 11,715 middle-aged adults in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) cohort with heart rate and HRV measures obtained from 2-min electrocardiogram recordings performed at baseline (1987 to 1989). These measures included SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals, high-frequency (HF) (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and the low-frequency/HF ratio (denoting a greater sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance). Incident AF cases were ascertained by electrocardiogram at ARIC follow-up visits, hospital discharge diagnosis, or death certificates through 2011. Results During an average follow-up of 19.4 years, 1,580 or 13.5% of participants developed AF. A baseline heart rate <60 beats/min was associated modestly with an increased risk of AF. Lower overall HRV as well as increased sympathetic/parasympathetic tone were associated independently with a higher risk of AF; the hazard ratio for each 1 SD lower SD of normal-to-normal RR intervals was 1.14 (95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.21), for HF was 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 1.17), and for low frequency/HF was 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.14). Conclusions Cardiac autonomic dysfunction denoted by low resting short-term HRV was associated with higher AF incidence. A low heart rate may be associated with higher AF risk. Further studies are needed to determine whether interventions in the general population to restore autonomic balance may prevent AF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sunil K."},{"family":"Norby","given":"Faye L."},{"family":"Whitsel","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lin Y."},{"family":"Loehr","given":"Laura R."},{"family":"Fuster","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Heiss","given":"Gerardo"},{"family":"Coresh","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"}],"citation-key":"Agarwal2017","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2016.10.059","ISSN":"15583597","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,24]]},"page":"291-299","PMID":"28104071","publisher":"Elsevier USA","title":"Cardiac Autonomic Dysfunction and Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation: Results From 20 Years Follow-Up","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

Schruers, Klaus Wiedemann, Cüneyt Demiralay Abstract Background The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are considered to play the most crucial role in the pathophysiology of stress responsiveness and are increasingly studied together. However, only few studies have simultaneously assessed HPA axis and ANS activity to investigate their direct interaction in pathophysiology, while no study so far has assessed the dynamic interplay between the two systems in healthy subjects through endocrine challenges. Methods The present study assessed the direct effects of overnight pharmacoendocrine HPA axis challenges with dexamethasone (suppression) and metyrapone (stimulation) on ANS activity at rest as determined by linear and nonlinear measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in 39 young healthy individuals. Results Findings indicated significant effects of metyrapone, but not dexamethasone on autonomic activity at rest based on HRV measures. HRV after metyrapone was overall significantly reduced in comparison to baseline or post-dexamethasone conditions, while the combined metyrapone-related reduction of HRV measures RMSSD, NN50(%) and HF(%) with concomitant increase of the unifractal scaling coefficient αfast value jointly indicated a specifically diminished vagal activity. Conclusions We provide first data that HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) is associated with reduced vagal tone, while HPA axis suppression (dexamethasone) has no effect on autonomic modulation of heart function. Our results support a vital role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the interplay between ANS and HPA axis and, thus, in the modulation of stress-related cardiovascular responsiveness and the susceptibility to stress-related disorders.","author":[{"family":"Agorastos","given":"Agorastos"},{"family":"Heinig","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Stiedl","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Hager","given":"Torben"},{"family":"Sommer","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jana C."},{"family":"Schruers","given":"Koen R."},{"family":"Wiedemann","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Demiralay","given":"Cüneyt"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Schruers","given":"Koen R."},{"family":"Wiedemann","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Demiralay","given":"Cüneyt"}],"citation-key":"Agorastos2018","container-title":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.017","ISSN":"03064530","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"page":"196-203","title":"Vagal effects of endocrine HPA axis challenges on resting autonomic activity assessed by heart rate variability measures in healthy humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453018310060?dgcid=rss_sd_all","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"Ahmadi2011","abstract":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction. However, a direct link between PTSD and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been made. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an excellent method to detect atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association of PTSD to atherosclerotic CAD and mortality. Six hundred thirty-seven veterans without known CAD (61 ± 9 years of age, 12.2% women) underwent CAC scanning for clinical indications and their psychological health status (PTSD vs non-PTSD) was evaluated. In subjects with PTSD, CAC was more prevalent than in the non-PTSD cohort (76.1% vs 59%, p = 0.001) and their CAC scores were significantly higher in each Framingham risk score category compared to the non-PTSD group. Multivariable generalized linear regression analysis identified PTSD as an independent predictor of presence and extent of atherosclerotic CAD (p <0.01). During a mean follow-up of 42 months, the death rate was higher in the PTSD compared to the non-PTSD group (15, 17.1%, vs 57, 10.4%, p = 0.003). Multivariable survival regression analyses revealed a significant linkage between PTSD and mortality and between CAC and mortality. After adjustment for risk factors, relative risk (RR) of death was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 2.91, p = 0.01) in subjects with PTSD and CAC score >0 compared to subjects without PTSD and CAC score equal to 0. With a CAC score equal to 0, risk of death was not different between subjects with and without PTSD (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.67 to 6.82, p = 0.4). Risk of death in each CAC category was higher in subjects with PTSD compared to matched subjects without PTSD (RRs 1.23 for CAC scores 1 to 100, 1.51 for CAC scores 101 to 400, and 1.81 for CAC scores <400, p <0.05 for all comparisons).

Our aim was to assess the effect of low-level left stellate ganglion (LSG) stimulation (SGS) on arrhythmias, hemodynamic, and cardiac electrophysiological indices. Patients undergoing ablation procedures for arrhythmias were recruited for SGS. A stimulating electrode was placed next to the LSG under fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging; and SGS (5–10 Hz, 10–20 mA) was performed. We measured hemodynamic, intracardiac and ECG parameters, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) (surrogate for action potential duration) from a duodecapolar catheter in the right ventricular outflow tract. Five patients underwent SGS (3 males, 45 ± 20 years). Stimulating catheter placement was successful, and without complication in all patients. SGS did not change heart rate, but increased mean arterial blood pressure (78 ± 3 mmHg to 98 ± 5 mmHg, P < 0.001) and dP/dt max (1148 ± 244 mmHg/sec to 1645 ± 493 mmHg/sec, P = 0.03). SGS shortened mean ARI from 304 ± 23 msec to 283 ± 17 msec (P < 0.001), although one patient required parasympathetic blockade. Dispersion of repolarization (DOR) increased in four patients and decreased in one, consistent with animal models. QT interval, T-wave duration and amplitude at baseline and with SGS were 415 ± 15 msec versus 399 ± 15 msec (P < 0.001); 201 ± 12 msec versus 230 ± 28 msec; and 0.2 ± 0.09 mV versus 0.22 ± 0.08 mV, respectively. At the level of SGS performed, no increase in arrhythmias was seen. Percutaneous low-level SGS shortens ARI in the RVOT, and increases blood pressure and LV contractility.

  {"id":"Akerstedt2018","abstract":"Summary Previous studies have found a U?shaped relationship between mortality and (weekday) sleep duration. We here address the association of both weekday and weekend sleep duration with overall mortality. A cohort of 43,880 subjects was followed for 13 years through record?linkages. Cox proportional hazards regression models with attained age as time?scale were fitted to estimate multivariable?adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for mortality; stratified analyses on age (<65 years, ≥65 years) were conducted. Among individuals <65 years old, short sleep (≤5 hr) during weekends at baseline was associated with a 52% higher mortality rate (hazard ratios 1.52; 95% confidence intervals 1.15?2.02) compared with the reference group (7 hr), while no association was observed for long (≥9 hr) weekend sleep. When, instead, different combinations of weekday and weekend sleep durations were analysed, we observed a detrimental association with consistently sleeping ≤5 hr (hazard ratios 1.65; 95% confidence intervals 1.22?2.23) or ≥8 hr (hazard ratios 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 1.05?1.50), compared with consistently sleeping 6?7 hr per day (reference). The mortality rate among participants with short sleep during weekdays, but long sleep during weekends, did not differ from the rate of the reference group. Among individuals ≥65 years old, no association between weekend sleep or weekday/weekend sleep durations and mortality was observed. In conclusion, short, but not long, weekend sleep was associated with an increased mortality in subjects <65 years. In the same age group, short sleep (or long sleep) on both weekdays and weekend showed increased mortality. Possibly, long weekend sleep may compensate for short weekday sleep.","author":[{"family":"Åkerstedt","given":"Torbjörn"},{"family":"Ghilotti","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Grotta","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongwei"},{"family":"Adami","given":"Hans-Olov"},{"family":"Trolle-Lagerros","given":"Ylva"},{"family":"Bellocco","given":"Rino"}],"citation-key":"Akerstedt2018","container-title":"Journal of Sleep Research","DOI":"10.1111/jsr.12712","ISBN":"0962-1105","ISSN":"09621105","issue":"April 2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"e12712","PMID":"29790200","title":"Sleep duration and mortality - Does weekend sleep matter?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/jsr.12712"},

Methods: Using inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data from 2008 to 2014 for a 5% sample of all beneficiaries 66 years of age or older, we identified patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and those diagnosed with atrial flutter. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke. In the primary analysis, patients with atrial flutter were censored upon converting to fibrillation; in a secondary analysis, they were not. Survival statistics were used to compare incidence of stroke in patients with flutter and patients with fibrillation. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the associations of flutter and fibrillation with ischemic stroke after adjustment for demographics and risk factors. Results: We identified 14,953 patients with flutter and 318,138 with fibrillation. During a mean follow-up period of 2.8 (±2.3) years, we identified 18,900 ischemic strokes. The annual incidence of ischemic stroke in patients with flutter was 1.38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22%-1.57%) compared with 2.02% (95% CI 1.99%-2.05%) in patients with fibrillation. After adjustment for demographics and stroke risk factors, flutter was associated with a lower risk of stroke compared with fibrillation (hazard ratio.69; 95% CI.60-.79, P <.05). Within 1 year, 65.7% (95% CI 64.9%-66.4%) of patients with flutter converted to fibrillation but remained at a lower risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio.85; 95% CI.78-.92).

Brief versions of mental arithmetic tasks have been used widely in previous reactivity studies, and growing attention to more socially salient tasks has led to the increased use of public speaking tasks. However, psychophysiological adjustment during extended and repeated exposure to these tasks has not been delineated. In the present study, 52 healthy men worked on three 8-min presentations of public speaking and of mental arithmetic in a repeated measure design. Both tasks produced substantial cardiovascular, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol responses; public speaking produced greater changes. Repeated presentations of public speaking produced a stable pattern of cardiac activation, whereas repetitions of the mental arithmetic initially produced large cardiac responses that changed to a more vascular tonus across task periods. Both tasks increased negative moods. However, correlations between the endocrine, cardiovascular, and negative moods were significant only during the public speaking stressor. The public speaking task is a socially relevant experimental protocol for studying reactivity in the laboratory setting and elicits relatively high, stable, and homogeneous responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Al'absi","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Bongard","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Pincomb","given":"Gwendolyn A."},{"family":"Licinio","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Lovallo","given":"William R."}],"citation-key":"Alabsi1997","container-title":"Psychophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02397.x","ISSN":"1469-8986","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","page":"266-275","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Cardiovascular and neuroendocrine adjustment to public speaking and mental arithmetic stressors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02397.x","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"Alba2013","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Ultrasonography is of growing importance within internal medicine (IM), but the optimal method of training doctors to use it is uncertain. In this study, the authors provide the first objective comparison of two approaches to training IM residents in ultrasonography. METHODS: In this randomised trial, a simulation-based ultrasound training curriculum was implemented during IM intern orientation at a tertiary care teaching hospital. All 72 incoming interns attended a lecture and were given access to online modules. Interns were then randomly assigned to a 4-hour faculty-guided (FG) or self-guided (SG) ultrasound training session in a simulation laboratory with both human and manikin models. Interns were asked to self-assess their competence in ultrasonography and underwent an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to assess their competence in basic and procedurally oriented ultrasound tasks. The primary outcome was the score on the OSCE. RESULTS: Faculty-guided training was superior to self-guided training based on the OSCE scores. Subjects in the FG training group achieved significantly higher OSCE scores on the two subsets of task completion (0.9-point difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-1.54; p = 0.008) and ultrasound image quality (2.43-point difference, 95% CI 1.5-3.36; p < 0.001). Both training groups demonstrated an increase in self-assessed competence after their respective training sessions and there was little difference between the groups. Subjects rated the FG training group much more favourably than the SG training group. CONCLUSIONS: Both FG and SG ultrasound training curricula can improve the self-reported competence of IM interns in ultrasonography. However, FG training was superior to SG training in both skills acquisition and intern preference. Incorporating mandatory ultrasound training into IM residencies can address the perceived need for ultrasound training, improve confidence and procedural skills, and may enhance patient safety. However, the optimal training method may require significant faculty input.","author":[{"family":"Alba","given":"George A."},{"family":"Kelmenson","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Vicki E."},{"family":"Murray","given":"Alice F."},{"family":"Currier","given":"Paul F."}],"citation-key":"Alba2013","container-title":"Medical Education","DOI":"10.1111/medu.12259","ISSN":"03080110","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"1099-1108","title":"Faculty staff-guided versus self-guided ultrasound training for internal medicine residents","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is commonly found in TBI. Although DAI can lead to physical and psychosocial disabilities, its prognostic value is still a matter of debate. Magnetic Resonance (MR) is more sensitive for detecting DAI lesions. Objective: To identify the radiological and clinical factors associated with the functional capacity one year after the traumatic brain injury. Methods: The study included 251 patients with severe head trauma for whom Brain MRI was done within one month after injury. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were collected during hospitalization. Neurocognitive and psychiatric evaluation were done one year thereafter. Results: DAI was more frequent in our patients. Psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, and poor functional outcome were more common in patients with DAI especially those with cerebral hemisphere and brain stem lesion, and mixed lesions. Duration of post traumatic amnesia (DPTA), lost consciousness and hospital stay (DHS) as well as the volume of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) were associated with poor neurocognitive outcome. DPTA, and DAIV may be considered independent factors that could predict the neurocognitive outcome.

  {"id":"Ali2019","abstract":"More than 2 decades ago, para-Hisian pacing was introduced to assess the pattern of retrograde conduction during electrophysiological studies. Although there is no ideal maneuver for every patient and condition, para-Hisian pacing is a valuable and handy strategy to differentiate between retrograde conduction over the atrioventricular node and the accessory pathways. The dynamic behavior of para-Hisian pacing, in a region with unique anatomical features, can produce various activation patterns and intriguing electrophysiological phenomena. Although the demonstration of a retrograde nodal activation pattern during para-Hisian pacing does not rule out the presence of an accessory pathway, evidence of retrograde conduction over an accessory pathway does not prove its active role in the culprit tachycardia. Multipolar His bundle recordings, detailed atrial mapping, and recognition of the truly captured structures and the impact of temporal changes of autonomic tone or pacing rates, are essential keys for accurate interpretation of this maneuver that may ultimately guide judicious catheter ablation of the arrhythmic substrate. This review aims to summarize the practical usefulness and potential pitfalls of the para-Hisian pacing maneuver, focusing on the interpretation of electrocardiograms and intracardiac recordings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ali","given":"Hussam"},{"family":"Foresti","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Lupo","given":"Pierpaolo"},{"family":"De Ambroggi","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Mantovani","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"De Lucia","given":"Carmine"},{"family":"Passarelli","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Cappato","given":"Riccardo"}],"citation-key":"Ali2019","container-title":"JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology","container-title-short":"JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacep.2019.08.017","ISSN":"2405-500X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"page":"1233-1252","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Para-Hisian Pacing: New Insights of an Old Pacing Maneuver","title-short":"Para-Hisian Pacing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405500X19306619","volume":"5"},

Transfusion has improved dramatically their prognosis, but provokes iron overload, which induces multiple organ damages. Iron overload is related to accumulation of iron released from hemolysis and transfused red cell, but also, in thalassemic patients, secondary to ineffective erythropoiesis, which increases intestinal iron absorption via decreased hepcidin production. Transfusion-related cardiac iron overload remains a main cause of death in thalassemia in well-resourced countries, and is responsible for severe hepatic damages in sickle cell disease. Regular monitoring by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using myocardial T2* (ms) and Liver Iron Content (LIC) (mg of iron/g dry weight) are now standards of care in chronically transfused patients. Serum ferritin level measurements and record of the total number of transfused erythrocyte concentrates are also helpful tools.

This population-based cohort study aimed to determine the association between depression of varying severity and risk for CVD and to study the effect of concomitant anxious distress on this association. METHODS We utilized data from a longitudinal cohort study of mental health, work and relations among adults (20-64 years), with a total of 10,443 individuals. Depression and anxious distress were assessed using psychiatric rating scales and defined according to DSM-5. Outcomes were register-based and self-reported cardiovascular diseases. FINDINGS Overall increased odds ratios of 1.5 to 2.6 were seen for the different severity levels of depression, with the highest adjusted OR for moderate depression (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.5). Similar odds ratios were seen for sub-groups of CVD: ischemic/hypertensive heart disease and stroke, 2.4 (95% CI 1.4, 3.9) and OR 2.1 (95%CI 1.2, 3.8) respectively. Depression with anxious distress as a specifier of severity showed OR of 2.1 (95% CI 1.5, 2.9) for CVD. CONCLUSION This study found that severity level of depression seems to be of significance for increased risk of CVD among depressed persons, although not in a dose-response manner which might be obscured due to treatment of depression.

Early-onset AF was defined as AF occurring in probands aged 60 years or younger in the absence of structural heart disease. All other forms were categorized as non-EOAF.

  {"id":"alzate2010","abstract":"Most biological processes are the result of the regulated expression of genes into their protein products in a defined temporal and spatial manner. The study of these dynamic protein changes in the brain is called neuroproteomics. A class of proteins expressed in the brain that have generated significant interests are those regulated by neural activity, called activity-dependent genes. The activity of neurons in the brain is important for normal brain function and expression of behavior. One system where the study of these features has been brought together is that of the songbird vocal learning system. Songbirds, and a limited number of animals (i.e., parrots, hummingbirds, bats, cetaceans, seals, elephants, and humans) are capable of vocal learning, the ability to produced imitative and improvisational sounds. Most animals do not have vocal learning but produce species-specific innate sounds used for alarm (e.g., predator) or other communication functions (e.g., alert for food or attracting a mate). The production of learned vocalizations requires the animal to process what it hears in the auditory pathway of the brain and then to produce the sounds heard, as song in songbirds or speech in humans, through specialized motor learning pathways. In songbirds and other vocal learning birds, this song learning motor pathway is organized into anatomically discrete nuclei that are not found in vocal non-learning birds. In this regard, songbirds represent a relatively unique animal model suited to the study of molecular mechanisms of a learned behavior with parallels to human speech. In recent years, a number of genes and their protein products have been identified that are regulated by neural activity during hearing and singing in the auditory and vocal brain pathways of songbirds. This chapter focuses on proteins regulated in the vocal pathway of songbirds performing learned vocalization. A discussion of proteins regulated in the auditory pathway by hearing is presented by Pinaud et al. in Chapter 14.","citation-key":"alzate2010","collection-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","editor":[{"family":"Alzate","given":"Oscar O"}],"event-place":"Boca Raton (FL)","ISBN":"978-1-4200-7625-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","PMID":"21882440","publisher":"CRC Press","publisher-place":"Boca Raton (FL)","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Neuroproteomics","type":"book"},
  {"id":"Ambari2019","abstract":"Introduction: Rheumatic mitral stenosis continues to be prevalent in developing countries, notably in endemic areas. Over the last few decades, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) has been established as a lower-cost alternative treatment for mitral stenosis (MS) in low-to-middle-income countries. PBMV has also been suggested to be an effective and safe alternative treatment modality. This study aims to analyse the survival of rheumatic MS patients treated with PBMV compared with those treated with mitral valve surgery (MVS). Methods: This study was a national, single-centre, longitudinal study using a survival analysis method in 329 consecutive patients suffering from rheumatic heart disease with severe MS who underwent PBMV compared with 142 consecutive patients with similar characteristics who underwent MVS between January 2011 and December 2016. Survival analysis and event-free duration were determined over a median follow-up of 24 months in the PBMV group and 27 months in the MVS group. Results: The results showed that of the 329 consecutive patients in the PBMV group, 61 patients (18.5) had an event (6 patients died and 55 patients were hospitalised), and of the 142 consecutive patients in the MVS group, 19 patients (13.4%) had an event (5 patients died, and 14 patients were hospitalised). The hazard ratio was 0.631 (95% confidence interval, 0.376–1.058; P = 0.081). Longer short-term survival was found in the MVS group but was not statistically significant. Event-free survival was significantly longer in the MVS group (P = 0.002), by 5 months. Conclusions: In this study, the efficacy and safety of PBMV was reconfirmed, as PBMV proved to be non-inferior to MVS in survival prognosis, but sustained event-free duration was significantly better in the MVS group than in the PBMV group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ambari","given":"A.

  {"id":"Ambrosy2021","abstract":"Importance: The current understanding of epidemiological mechanisms and temporal trends in hospitalizations for worsening heart failure (WHF) is based on claims and national reporting databases. However, these data sources are inherently limited by the accuracy and completeness of diagnostic coding and/or voluntary reporting. Objective: To assess the overall burden of and temporal trends in the rate of hospitalizations for WHF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study, performed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, used electronic health record (EHR) data from a large integrated health care delivery system. Exposures: Calendar year trends. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalizations for WHF (ie, excluding observation stays) were defined as 1 symptom or more, 2 objective findings or more including 1 sign or more, and 2 doses or more of intravenous loop diuretics and/or new hemodialysis or continuous kidney replacement therapy. Symptoms and signs were identified using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms applied to EHR data. Results: The study population was composed of 118002 eligible patients experiencing 287992 unique hospitalizations (mean [SD] age, 75.6 [13.1] years; 147203 [51.1%] male; 1655 [0.6%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 28451 [9.9%] Asian or Pacific Islander, 34903 [12.1%] Black, 23452 [8.1%] multiracial, 175840 [61.1%] White, and 23691 [8.2%] unknown), including 65357 with a principal discharge diagnosis and 222635 with a secondary discharge diagnosis of HF. The study population included 59868 patients (20.8%) with HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (<40%), 33361 (11.6%) with HF with a midrange EF (HFmrEF) (40%-49%), 142347 (49.4%) with HF with a preserved EF (HFpEF) (≥50%), and 52416 (18.2%) with unknown EF. A total of 58042 admissions (88.8%) with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and 62764 admissions (28.2%) with a secondary discharge diagnosis of HF met the prespecified diagnostic criteria for WHF. Overall, hospitalizations for WHF identified on NLP-based algorithms increased from 5.2 to 7.6 per 100 hospitalizations per year during the study period. Subgroup analyses found an increase in hospitalizations for WHF based on NLP from 1.5 to 1.9 per 100 hospitalizations for HFrEF, from 0.6 to 1.0 per 100 hospitalizations for HFmrEF, and from 2.6 to 3.9 per 100 hospitalizations for HFpEF. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that the burden of hospitalizations for WHF may be more than double that previously estimated using only principal discharge diagnosis. There has been a gradual increase in the rate of hospitalizations for WHF with a more noticeable increase observed for HFpEF..","author":[{"family":"Ambrosy","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Parikh","given":"Rishi V."},{"family":"Sung","given":"Sue Hee"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Anand"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Rajeev"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Phuong Quang"},{"family":"Kheder","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Iwahashi","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Hardwick","given":"Alexander B."},{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"Jesse K."},{"family":"Avula","given":"Harshith R."},{"family":"Selby","given":"Van N."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xian"},{"family":"Sanghera","given":"Navneet"},{"family":"Cristino","given":"Joaquim"},{"family":"Go","given":"Alan S."}],"citation-key":"Ambrosy2021","container-title":"JAMA Network Open","DOI":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.35152","ISSN":"25743805","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"PMID":"34807259","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"A Natural Language Processing-Based Approach for Identifying Hospitalizations for Worsening Heart Failure within an Integrated Health Care Delivery System","type":"article-journal"},

We hypothesized that an increased vulnerability in women may stem from a more adverse autonomic response to acute mental stress than men. Methods: We studied 78 post-MI patients (39 women and 39 men) age 18-59 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. All patients underwent mental stress testing with a public speech stressor, as well as conventional exercise or pharmacological testing. Autonomic function was measured via heart rate variability [high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) HRV] from ambulatory ECG monitoring before and during mental stress. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of sex on the change in HRV between rest and stress. Results: The mean (SD) age was 50 (6) years, 45% had an ST-elevation MI, and 54% were black. The baseline mean HF HRV was higher for women than men, 5.9 (1.4) vs. 5.3 (1.0) ln(ms2), p=0.04, while baseline LF HRV was similar by sex. During the speech preparation and delivery, HF HRV decreased more in women (-83%) than men (-59%), p=0.005. LF HRV also decreased more in women (-69 % vs -37 %, p=0.046). After adjusting for race, CAD risk factors, ejection fraction, angiographic CAD severity, and medications (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and statins), this difference remained significant for both HF (p=0.01) and LF (p=0.03). Addition of depression and anti-depressants to the model did not change the relationship. The sex difference was more pronounced as age decreased, with sex-age interaction of p=0.01 for HF and 0.055 for LF. No sex differences in either HF or LF HRV were found during exercise stress. Conclusion: In young adults with recent MI, women have greater reduction in HRV than men during acute psychological stress, denoting a more adverse autonomic response to stress. The younger the age, the more pronounced the sex difference. In contrast, no differences are observed during exercise stress. Given the prognostic value of HRV, these findings may help to explain sex-based differences in post-MI outcomes particularly for younger women.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Amit J Shah, Pratik M Pimple, Cherie Rooks, Rachel Lampert, Ijeom Ibeanu, Nancy Murrah, J.

This prospective study was done to identify the incidence, mortality, and clinical factors that resulted in a poor outcome in both groups of patients. We screened a total of 10,811 consecutive arterial blood gas values; in 4,427 (40.9%) the pH was greater than 7.44, and in 2,577 (23.8%) the pH was greater than 7.48. The study group consisted of 409 patients (213 medical, 196 surgical) whose pH value was greater than 7.48; 253 of these patients (61.9%) had pure respiratory alkalosis, 120 (29.3%) had mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, 27 (6.6%) had a mixed acid base disorder, and nine (2.2%) had pure metabolic alkalosis. Overall group mortality was 27.9% and increased as pH values rose, reaching 48.5% when the pH was greater than 7.60. The overall mortality among medical patients (36.6%) exceeded that among the surgical patients (12.4%) (P less than .05), an observation that applied over a wide range of pH values. Patients having mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis had a significantly poorer outcome (44.2% mortality) than the alkalemic group as a whole (27.9% mortality) (P less than .05). Alkalemia-associated illnesses are common in hospitalized patients and are associated with high mortality in both medical and surgical patients, though the death rate is higher among medical patients.

  {"id":"Anderson1999a","abstract":"Background-The Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Study compared treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators versus antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). AVID maintained a Registry on all patients, randomized or not, with any VA or unexplained syncope who could be considered for either of the treatment strategies. Trial-eligible arrhythmias were the categories of VF cardiac arrest; Syncopal VT, and Symptomatic VT, below. Methods and Results-Of 5989 patients screened, 4595 were registered and 1016 were randomized. Mortality follow-up through 1996 was obtained on the 4219 Registry patients enrolled before 1997 through the National Death Index. Crude mortality rates (mean±SD, follow-up, 16.9±11.5 months) were: VF cardiac arrest, 17.0% (n=1399, 238 deaths); Syncopal VT, 21.2% (n=598, 127 deaths); Symptomatic VT, 15.8% (n= 1065, 168 deaths); Stable (asymptomatic) VT, 19.7% (n=497, 98 deaths); VT/VF with transient/correctable cause, 17.8% (n=270, 48 deaths); and Unexplained syncope, 12.3% (n=390, 48 deaths). Conclusions-Patients with seemingly lower-risk or unknown-risk VAs (asymptomatic VT, and VT/VF associated with a transient factor) have a (high) mortality similar to that of higher-risk, AVID-eligible VAs. The similar (and poor) prognosis of most patients with VT/VF suggests the need for reevaluation of a priori risk grouping and raises the question of the appropriate arrhythmia therapy for a broad range of patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Jeffrey L."},{"family":"Hallstrom","given":"Alfred P."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Andrew E."},{"family":"Pinski","given":"Sergio L."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Nora","given":"Matthew O."},{"family":"Chilson","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Cannom","given":"David S."},{"family":"Moore","given":"Rich"}],"citation-key":"Anderson1999a","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.99.13.1692","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",4,6]]},"page":"1692-1699","PMID":"10190878","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Design and results of the antiarrhythmics vs implantable defibrillators (AVID) registry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10190878/","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Ando2018","abstract":"Objectives: Although percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage is supported as a potential alternative to lifelong anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation, comprehensive evidence on surgical left atrial appendage closure in heart surgery is limited. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing patients who underwent open cardiac surgery with or without left atrial appendage closure. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Trials databases. Outcomes of interest were 30-day/in-hospital mortality and cerebrovascular accident. I2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity, and publication bias was evaluated by Begg's and Egger's tests. Results: We reviewed 1284 articles and selected for main analysis 7 articles including 3897 patients (1963 in the left atrial appendage closure group and 1934 in the non–left atrial appendage closure group). Among the 7 studies, 3 were randomized-controlled studies, 3 were propensity-matched studies, and 1 was a case-matching study. At 30-day/in-hospital follow-up, left atrial appendage closure was significantly associated with decreased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular accident (odds ratio, 0.384, 95% confidence interval, 0.233-0.631 for mortality, and odds ratio, 0.622, 95% confidence interval, 0.388-0.998 for cerebrovascular accident). Stratified analysis demonstrated that this association was more prominent in preoperative atrial fibrillation strata. Conclusions: Concomitant surgical left atrial appendage closure should be considered at the time of open cardiac surgery, particularly among those in atrial fibrillation preoperatively. The benefit of left atrial appendage closure for patients not in atrial fibrillation and for those undergoing nonvalvular surgery is still unclear.

  {"id":"Andrade2014","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia (estimated lifetime risk, 22%-26%). The aim of this article is to review the clinical epidemiological features of AF and to relate them to underlying mechanisms. Long-established risk factors for AF include aging, male sex, hypertension, valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Emerging risk factors include prehypertension, increased pulse pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level physical training, diastolic dysfunction, predisposing gene variants, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. Potential risk factors are coronary artery disease, kidney disease, systemic inflammation, pericardial fat, and tobacco use. AF has substantial population health consequences, including impaired quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, stroke occurrence, and increased medical costs. The pathophysiology of AF centers around 4 general types of disturbances that promote ectopic firing and reentrant mechanisms, and include the following: (1) ion channel dysfunction, (2) Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities, (3) structural remodeling, and (4) autonomic neural dysregulation. Aging, hypertension, valve disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and endurance exercise training all cause structural remodeling. Heart failure and prior atrial infarction also cause Ca(2+)-handling abnormalities that lead to focal ectopic firing via delayed afterdepolarizations/triggered activity. Neural dysregulation is central to atrial arrhythmogenesis associated with endurance exercise training and occlusive coronary artery disease. Monogenic causes of AF typically promote the arrhythmia via ion channel dysfunction, but the mechanisms of the more common polygenic risk factors are still poorly understood and under intense investigation. Better recognition of the clinical epidemiology of AF, as well as an improved appreciation of the underlying mechanisms, is needed to develop improved methods for AF prevention and management.","author":[{"family":"Andrade","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Khairy","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Dobrev","given":"Dobromir"},{"family":"Nattel","given":"Stanley"}],"citation-key":"Andrade2014","container-title":"Circulation research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303211","ISSN":"1524-4571","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,25]]},"page":"1453-68","PMID":"24763464","title":"The clinical profile and pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation: relationships among clinical features, epidemiology, and mechanisms.","type":"article-journal","volume":"114"},

  {"id":"Ang2014","abstract":"Introduction: Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has been shown to protect against ven-tricular tachyarrhythmia (VT). The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown and it also remains unclear whether acute or chronic withdrawal of tonic vagal efferent activity to the heart predisposes the heart to VT. To investigate this, we acutely silenced the vagal preganglio-nic neurones in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DVMN) in a rat model using a pharmogenetic approach, and we used the triple-synuclein-null mice as a model of autonomic dysfunction associated with chronic reduction of vagal tone. Methods: In 12 male Sprague-Dawley rats (380-420g), lentiviral vectors were used to transduce DVMN neurones to express an inhibitory Gi-protein-coupled Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR) or green fluorescent protein as a control. Application of a natural ligand of AlstR-an insect peptide allatostatin (5 ml) produces selective and rapid silencing of targeted neurones. To investigate the role of age-dependent autonomic dysfunction, 7 young (2-3 months) and 8 old (12-16 months) wild type (WT) and triple-synuclein-null (TKO) mice were studied. The animals underwent programmed electrical stimulation of the right ventricle under urethane anaesthesia (1.3g/kg) to obtain ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducibility by burst pacing was also assessed in the acute rat models. Results: Acute inhibition of the DVMN vagal preganglionic neurones in rats resulted in shortening of the VERP (32.6 + 0.8 vs 41.5 + 0.5 ms; p ¼ 0.002) and lowered VT threshold on burst pacing (21.7 + 4.2 vs 44.4 + 8.9 Hz; p ¼ 0.043). Young TKO mice showed no difference in VERP (37.0 + 5.2 vs 37.0 + 3.1 ms). However, development of autonomic dysfunc-tion in older TKO mice was associated with a reduction in VERP (30.6 + 2.3 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.003). In old WT animals, systemic administration of methylatropine (2mg/kg) mimicked the pro-arrhythmic phenotype of synuclein deficiency with significant VERP shortening (31.0 + 2.6 vs 43.4 + 2.3 ms; p ¼ 0.004). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that both acute and chronic decrease in activity of a distinct population of vagal preganglionic neurones in the DVMN predisposes the heart to ven-tricular arrhythmia by reduction of the effective refractory period.

  {"id":"Antzelevitch2008","abstract":"Spatial dispersion of repolarization in the form of transmural, trans-septal and apico-basal dispersion of repolarization creates voltage gradients that inscribe the J wave and T wave of the EGG. Amplification of this spatial dispersion of repolarization (SDR) underlies the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias associated with inherited or acquired ion channelopathies giving rise to the long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes (BrS). This review focuses on the role of spatial dispersion of repolarization in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis associated with the long QT and BrS. In the long QT syndrome, drug-induced amplification of SDR is often secondary to preferential prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) of M cells, whereas in the BrS, it is thought to be due to selective abbreviation of the APD of right ventricular epicardium. Among the challenges ahead is the identification of a means to quantitate SDR non-invasively. This review also discusses the value of the interval between the peak and end of the T wave (Tpeak-Tend, Tp-Te) as an index of SDR and transmural dispersion of repolarization, in particular.

  {"id":"Aras2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND Abnormal QT intervals, long QT or short QT, have been epidemiologically linked with sudden cardiac death because of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Consequently, Food and Drug Administration recommends testing all pharmacological agents for QT toxicity as a risk factor for cardiac toxicity. Such tests assess QT/QTc interval, which represents ventricular depolarization and repolarization. However, the current QT toxicity analysis does not account for the well-known anisotropy in cardiac tissue conductivity. Mines demonstrated in 1913 that cardiac wavelength (λ) determines inducibility of reentrant arrhythmia, where both repolarization time or action potential duration and conduction velocity determine λ=action potential duration×conduction velocity. We aimed to determine the role of anisotropic wavelength in inducibility of VF in explanted human left ventricular preparations. We tested the hypothesis that 3-dimensional cardiac wavelength, which takes into account anisotropic cardiac tissue conductivity, can accurately predict VF sustainability. METHODS We conducted panoramic optical mapping of coronary perfused human left ventricular wedge preparations subjected to pharmacologically induced shortening and prolongation of action potential duration, by IK,ATP agonist pinacidil and antagonist glybenclamide, respectively. This measured action potential duration, conduction velocity, and thus determined pacing cycle length-dependent wavelengths in longitudinal (λL), transverse (λTV), and transmural (λTM) directions using S1S1 pacing protocol, from which wavelength volume (Vλ) was determined, as Vλ=λL×λTV×λTM, and compared with tissue volume. We tested a hypothesis that tissue volume/Vλ ratio can predict VF sustainability. RESULTS At baseline, at pacing rate of 240 beats per minute, the wavelengths were λL=9.6±0.6 cm, λTV=4.2±0.3 cm, and λTM=5.8±0.2 cm, respectively (n=7), and thus Vλ=246.4±42.1 cm3. Administration of pinacidil at escalating concentrations progressively decreased Vλ, and VF became sustained, when tissue volume/Vλ was above safety factor κ=4.4±0.6 (n=9) during rapid pacing. Treatment with glybenclamide decreased VT/Vλ below κ at any pacing rate and prevented VF sustainability. CONCLUSIONS Sustained VF was only sustained in ventricular volume exceeding critical Vλ=λL×λTV×λTM.","author":[{"family":"Aras","given":"Kedar K."},{"family":"Faye","given":"Ndeye Rokhaya"},{"family":"Cathey","given":"Brianna"},{"family":"Efimov","given":"Igor R."}],"citation-key":"Aras2018","container-title":"Circulation.

Localised epicardial distortion modified the activity generated by 34 neurones [0.19(SEM 0.02) to 1.2(0.4) impulses.s-1]. Application of bradykinin, substance P, N6-cyclopentyladenosine or beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate to localised epicardial fields altered the activity of 69 neurones. Thus the majority of identified epicardial neurones responded to chemical stimuli alone (63%) as opposed to mechanical stimuli alone (25%), 12% responding to both types of stimuli. Activity was enhanced overall by chemical stimuli from a mean range of 0.1-0.4 to 11.6-13.2 impulses.s-1. Following termination of short lasting chemical as opposed to mechanical stimuli, activity remained increased for up to 45 min.

  {"id":"Armour1997","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The extent and locations of intrinsic cardiac ganglia on the human heart were investigated to facilitate studying their function. METHODS: The locations and number of major intrinsic cardiac ganglia were determined in six human hearts by means of microdissection following methylene blue staining. Light and electron microscopic analyses were performed on right atrial and cranial medial ventricular ganglia obtained from 12 other human hearts. RESULTS: Gross anatomy: Collections of ganglia associated with nerves, i.e., ganglionated plexuses, were observed consistently in five atrial and five ventricular regions. Occasional ganglia were located in other atrial and ventricular regions. Atrial ganglionated plexuses were identified on 1) the superior surface of the right atrium, 2) the superior surface of the left atrium, 3) the posterior surface of the right atrium, 4) the posterior medial surface of the left atrium (the latter two fuse medially where they extend anteriorly into the interatrial septum), and 5) the inferior and lateral aspect of the posterior left atrium. Ventricular ganglionated plexuses were located in fat 1) surrounding the aortic root, 2) at the origins of the right and left coronary arteries (the latter extending to the origins of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries), 3) at the origin of the posterior descending coronary artery, 4) adjacent to the origin of the right acute marginal coronary artery, and 5) at the origin of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Microscopic anatomy: Ganglia ranged in size from those containing a few neurons to large ganglia measuring up to 0.5 x 1 mm. The human heart is estimated to contain more than 14,000 neurons. Neuronal somata varied in size and shape. Many axon terminals in intrinsic cardiac ganglia contained large numbers of small, clear, round vesicles that formed asymmetrical axodendritic synapses, whereas a few axons contained large, dense-cored vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: The human intrinsic cardiac nervous system is distributed more extensively than was considered previously, most of its ganglia being located on the posterior surfaces of the atria and superior aspect of the ventricles. Each ganglion therein contains a variety of neurons that are associated with complex synaptology.","author":[{"family":"Armour","given":"J.

  {"id":"Armour1999","abstract":"The intrinsic cardiac nervous system has been classically considered to contain only parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones which receive inputs from medullary parasympathetic efferent preganglionic neurones. In such a view, intrinsic cardiac ganglia act as simple relay stations of parasympathetic efferent neuronal input to the heart, the major autonomic control of the heart purported to reside solely in the brainstem and spinal cord. Data collected over the past two decades indicate that processing occurs within the mammalian intrinsic cardiac nervous system which involves afferent neurones, local circuit neurones (interconnecting neurones) as well as both sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent postganglionic neurones. As such, intrinsic cardiac ganglionic interactions represent the organ component of the hierarchy of intrathoracic nested feedback control loops which provide rapid and appropriate reflex coordination of efferent autonomic neuronal outflow to the heart. In such a concept, the intrinsic cardiac nervous system acts as a distributive processor, integrating parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent centrifugal information to the heart in addition to centripetal information arising from cardiac sensory neurites. A number of neurochemicals have been shown to influence the interneuronal interactions which occur within the intrathoracic cardiac nervous system. For instance, pharmacological interventions that modify b-adrenergic or angiotensin II receptors affect cardiomyocyte function not only directly, but indirectly by influencing the capacity of intrathoracic neurones to regulate cardiomyocytes. Thus, current pharmacological management of heart disease may influence cardiomyocyte function directly as well as indirectly secondary to modifying the cardiac nervous system. This review presents a brief summary of developing concepts about the role of the cardiac nervous system in regulating the normal heart. In addition, it provides some tentative ideas concerning the importance of this nervous system in cardiac disease states with a view to stimulating further interest in neural control of the heart so that appropriate neurocardiological strategies can be devised for the management of heart disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Armour","given":"J Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Armour1999","container-title":"European heart journal","ISSN":"0195-668X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",12]]},"page":"1751-2","PMID":"8681998","title":"Myocardial ischaemia and the cardiac nervous system.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/41/1/41/317013","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Arora2010","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Emotional intelligence (EI) involves the perception, processing, regulation and management of emotions. This article aims to systematically review the evidence for EI in medicine through the context of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competencies. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for English-language articles published between January 1980 and March 2009. The grey literature was also searched and experts in the field contacted for additional studies. Two independent reviewers selected articles which reported empirical research studies about clinicians or medical students. Conceptual articles and opinion pieces and commentaries were excluded. Information about the measure used to assess EI, the study parameter or domain, and the educational or clinical outcome (with specific relation to the ACGME competencies) was extracted. RESULTS: The literature search identified 485 citations. An abstract review led to the retrieval of 24 articles for full-text assessment, of which 16 articles were included in the final review. Eleven studies focused on postgraduates, four on undergraduates and one on medical school applicants. Six out of seven studies found women to have higher EI than men. Higher EI was reported to positively contribute to the doctor-patient relationship (three studies), increased empathy (five studies), teamwork and communication skills (six studies), and stress management, organisational commitment and leadership (three studies). CONCLUSIONS: Measures of EI correlate with many of the competencies that modern medical curricula seek to deliver. Further research is required to determine whether training can improve EI and thus augment educational and clinical outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Arora","given":"Sonal"},{"family":"Ashrafian","given":"Hutan"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Athanasiou","given":"Thanos"},{"family":"Darzi","given":"Ara"},{"family":"Sevdalis","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"Arora2010","container-title":"Medical Education","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03709.x","ISBN":"0308-0110","ISSN":"03080110","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,15]]},"page":"749-764","PMID":"20633215","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","title":"Emotional intelligence in medicine: A systematic review through the context of the ACGME competencies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03709.x","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"Arri2016","abstract":"Objective: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. Methods: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [99mTc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. Results: The mean age was 50. years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. Conclusion: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Arri","given":"S S"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"M"},{"family":"Redwood","given":"S R"},{"family":"Marber","given":"M S"}],"citation-key":"Arri2016","container-title":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307306","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"9783319324807","ISSN":"1355-6037","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3]]},"page":"472-480","PMID":"25727240","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","title":"Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://heart.bmj.com/","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"arriaga2012","abstract":"Humans and song-learning birds communicate acoustically using learned vocalizations. The characteristic features of this social communication behavior include vocal control by forebrain motor areas, a direct cortical projection to brainstem vocal motor neurons, and dependence on auditory feedback to develop and maintain learned vocalizations. These features have so far not been found in closely related primate and avian species that do not learn vocalizations. Male mice produce courtship ultrasonic vocalizations with acoustic features similar to songs of song-learning birds. However, it is assumed that mice lack a forebrain system for vocal modification and that their ultrasonic vocalizations are innate. Here we investigated the mouse song system and discovered that it includes a motor cortex region active during singing, that projects directly to brainstem vocal motor neurons and is necessary for keeping song more stereotyped and on pitch. We also discovered that male mice depend on auditory feedback to maintain some ultrasonic song features, and that sub-strains with differences in their songs can match each other's pitch when cross-housed under competitive social conditions. We conclude that male mice have some limited vocal modification abilities with at least some neuroanatomical features thought to be unique to humans and song-learning birds. To explain our findings, we propose a continuum hypothesis of vocal learning.","author":[{"family":"Arriaga","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Eric P"},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Erich D"}],"citation-key":"arriaga2012","container-title":"PloS one","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0046610","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"e46610","PMID":"23071596","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Of mice, birds, and men: the mouse ultrasonic song system has some features similar to humans and song-learning birds","title-short":"Of mice, birds, and men","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"arriaga2013","abstract":"Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are often used as behavioral readouts of internal states, to measure effects of social and pharmacological manipulations, and for behavioral phenotyping of mouse models for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms of rodent USV production. Here we discuss the available data to assess whether male mouse song behavior and the supporting brain circuits resemble those of known vocal non-learning or vocal learning species. Recent neurobiology studies have demonstrated that the mouse USV brain system includes motor cortex and striatal regions, and that the vocal motor cortex sends a direct sparse projection to the brainstem vocal motor nucleus ambiguous, a projection previously thought be unique to humans among mammals. Recent behavioral studies have reported opposing conclusions on mouse vocal plasticity, including vocal ontogeny changes in USVs over early development that might not be explained by innate maturation processes, evidence for and against a role for auditory feedback in developing and maintaining normal mouse USVs, and evidence for and against limited vocal imitation of song pitch. To reconcile these findings, we suggest that the trait of vocal learning may not be dichotomous but encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral and neural traits we call the continuum hypothesis, and that mice possess some of the traits associated with a capacity for limited vocal learning.","author":[{"family":"Arriaga","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Erich D"}],"citation-key":"arriaga2013","container-title":"Brain and language","container-title-short":"Brain Lang","DOI":"10.1016/j.bandl.2012.10.002","ISSN":"1090-2155","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1]]},"page":"96-116","PMID":"23295209","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Mouse vocal communication system: Are ultrasounds learned or innate?","title-short":"Mouse vocal communication system","type":"article-journal","volume":"124"},

  {"id":"Arruda1998","abstract":"Introduction: Delta wave morphology correlates with the site of ventricular insertion of accessory AV pathways. Because lesions due to radiofrequency (RF) current are small and well defined, it may allow precise localization of accessory pathways. The purpose of this study was to use RF catheter ablation to develop an ECG algorithm to predict accessory pathway location. Methods and Results: An algorithm was developed by correlating a resting 12-lead ECG with the successful RF ablation site in 135 consecutive patients with a single, anterogradely conducting accessory pathway (Retrospective phase). This algorithm was subsequently tested prospectively in 121 consecutive patients (Prospective phase). The ECG findings included the initial 20 msec of the delta wave in leads I, II, aVF, and V1 [classified as positive (+), negative (-), or isoelectric (±)] and the ratio of R and S wave amplitudes in leads III and V1 (classified as R ≤ S or R < S). When tested prospectively, the ECG algorithm accurately localized the accessory pathway to 1 of 10 sites around the tricuspid and mitral annuli or at subepicardial locations within the venous system of the heart. Overall sensitivity was 90% and specificity was 99%. The algorithm was particularly useful in correctly localizing anteroseptal (sensitivity 75%, specificity 99%), and mid-septal (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98%) accessory pathways as well as pathways requiring ablation from within ventricular venous branches or anomalies of the coronary sinus (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Conclusion: A simple ECG algorithm identifies accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. A truly negative delta wave in lead II predicts ablation within the coronary venous system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Arruda","given":"Mauricio S"},{"family":"Mcclelland","given":"James H"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xanzhung"},{"family":"Beckman","given":"Karen J"},{"family":"Widman","given":"Lawrence E"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Mario D"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Lazzara","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Warren M"}],"citation-key":"Arruda1998","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8167.1998.tb00861.x","ISSN":"10453873","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"2-12","PMID":"9475572","title":"Development and validation of an ECG algorithm for identifying accessory pathway ablation site in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Asbun2006","abstract":"Diabetes has emerged as a major threat to worldwide health. The increasing incidence of diabetes in young individuals is particularly worrisome given that the disease is likely to evolve over a period of years. In 1972, the existence of a diabetic cardiomyopathy was proposed based on the experience with four adult diabetic patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in the absence of discernible coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease, hypertension, or alcoholism. The exact mechanisms underlying the disease are unknown; however, an important component of the pathological alterations observed in these hearts includes the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in particular collagens. The excess deposition of ECM in the heart mirrors what occurs in other organs such as the kidney and peritoneum of diabetics. Mechanisms responsible for these alterations may include the excess production, reduced degradation, and/or chemical modification of ECM proteins. These effects may be the result of direct or indirect actions of high glucose concentrations. This article reviews our state of knowledge on the effects that diabetes-like conditions exert on the cells responsible for ECM production as well as relevant experimental and clinical data. © 2006 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Asbun","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Villarreal","given":"Francisco J."}],"citation-key":"Asbun2006","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2005.09.050","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,21]]},"page":"693-700","publisher":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","title":"The pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis in the setting of diabetic cardiomyopathy","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"Attia2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health. METHODS: We trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499 727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275 056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation. RESULTS: Of 275 056 patients tested, 52% were males and mean age was 58.6±16.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4% classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9±5.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51%) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of <7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by >7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P<0.01). In the 27% of patients where correlation was >0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33±12 years). CONCLUSIONS: Applying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.","author":[{"family":"Attia","given":"Zachi I."},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Noseworthy","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Lopez-Jimenez","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Ladewig","given":"Dorothy J."},{"family":"Satam","given":"Gaurav"},{"family":"Pellikka","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Munger","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Asirvatham","given":"Samuel J."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Rickey E."},{"family":"Kapa","given":"Suraj"}],"citation-key":"Attia2019","container-title":"Circulation.

  {"id":"Austin2006","abstract":"Objectives: To illustrate how multiple hypotheses testing can produce associations with no clinical plausibility. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a study of all 10,674,945 residents of Ontario aged between 18 and 100 years in 2000. Residents were randomly assigned to equally sized derivation and validation cohorts and classified according to their astrological sign. Using the derivation cohort, we searched through 223 of the most common diagnoses for hospitalization until we identified two for which subjects born under one astrological sign had a significantly higher probability of hospitalization compared to subjects born under the remaining signs combined (P < 0.05). Results: We tested these 24 associations in the independent validation cohort. Residents born under Leo had a higher probability of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (P = 0.0447), while Sagittarians had a higher probability of humerus fracture (P = 0.0123) compared to all other signs combined. After adjusting the significance level to account for multiple comparisons, none of the identified associations remained significant in either the derivation or validation cohort. Conclusions: Our analyses illustrate how the testing of multiple, non-prespecified hypotheses increases the likelihood of detecting implausible associations.

  {"id":"Aviv2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Qualitative CT perfusion (CTP) assessment by using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) allows rapid calculation of infarct extent for middle cerebral artery infarcts. Published thresholds exist for noncontrast CT (NCCT) ASPECTS, which may distinguish outcome/complication risk, but early ischemic signs are difficult to detect. We hypothesized that different ASPECTS thresholds exist for CTP parameters versus NCCT and that these may be superior at predicting clinical and radiologic outcome in the acute setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six baseline acute stroke NCCT and CTP studies within 3 hours of symptoms were blindly reviewed by 3 neuroradiologists, and ASPECTS were assigned. Treatment response was defined as major neurologic improvement when a > or =8-point National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement at 24 hours occurred. Follow-up NCCT ASPECTS and 90-day modified Rankin score (mRS) were radiologic and clinical reference standards. Receiver operating characteristic curves derived optimal thresholds for outcome. RESULTS: Cerebral blood volume and NCCT ASPECTS had similar radiologic correlations (0.6 and 0.5, respectively) and best predicted infarct size in the absence of major neurologic improvement. A NCCT ASPECT threshold of 7 and a cerebral blood volume threshold of 8 discriminated patients with poor follow-up scans (P < .0002 and P = .0001) and mRS < or =2 (P = .001 and P < .001). Only cerebral blood volume predicted major neurologic improvement (P = .02). Interobserver agreement was substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.69). Cerebral blood volume ASPECTS sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for clinical outcome were 60%, 100%, 100%, and 45%, respectively. No patients with cerebral blood volume ASPECTS <8 achieved good clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Cerebral blood volume ASPECTS is equivalent to NCCT for predicting radiologic outcome but may have an additional benefit in predicting patients with major neurologic improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Aviv","given":"R.

Existing algorithms are sensitive to differences in pulse pressure and artery stiffness. Some are closely guarded trade secrets. Accurate extraction of systolic and diastolic pressures from the envelope of cuff pressure oscillations remains an open problem in biomedical engineering.\\n\\nMETHODS: A new analysis of relevant anatomy, physiology and physics reveals the mechanisms underlying the production of cuff pressure oscillations as well as a way to extract systolic and diastolic pressures from the envelope of oscillations in any individual subject. Stiffness characteristics of the compressed artery segment can be extracted from the envelope shape to create an individualized mathematical model. The model is tested with a matrix of possible systolic and diastolic pressure values, and the minimum least squares difference between observed and predicted envelope functions indicates the best fit choices of systolic and diastolic pressure within the test matrix.\\n\\nRESULTS: The model reproduces realistic cuff pressure oscillations. The regression procedure extracts systolic and diastolic pressures accurately in the face of varying pulse pressure and arterial stiffness. The root mean squared error in extracted systolic and diastolic pressures over a range of challenging test scenarios is 0.3 mmHg.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A new algorithm based on physics and physiology allows accurate extraction of systolic and diastolic pressures from cuff pressure oscillations in a way that can be validated, criticized, and updated in the public domain.","author":[{"family":"Babbs","given":"Charles F."}],"citation-key":"Babbs2012","container-title":"BioMedical Engineering Online","DOI":"10.1186/1475-925X-11-56","ISBN":"1475-925X","ISSN":"1475925X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"1-22","PMID":"22913792","title":"Oscillometric measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressures validated in a physiologic mathematical model","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"Baez-Escudero2014","abstract":"Objectives\nTo determine whether ethanol infusion in the vein of Marshall (VOM) can ablate intrinsic cardiac nerves (ICN).\n\nBackground\nICN cluster around the left atrial epicardium, and are implicated in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\nMethods\nPatients undergoing catheter AF ablation underwent adjunctive ethanol injection in the VOM. A multipolar catheter was introduced in the VOM and used for high-frequency stimulation (HFS), either as SynchHFS (P-wave-synchronized, 30 pulses, 100 Hz, n=8) or as BurstHFS (5–10 second bursts, 33 Hz, n=72) at 25 mA, 1 ms duration. Atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction slowing (asystole >2s or R-R interval prolongation >50%) and AF inducibility were assessed before and after VOM ethanol infusion. Up to four 1mL infusions of 98% ethanol were delivered via an angioplasty balloon in the VOM.\n\nResults\nSynchHFS induced AF in 8/8 patients. In 4/8 AF initiated spontaneously without VOM capture. No parasympathetic responses were elicited by SynchHFS. BurstHFS was performed in 32 patients undergoing de novo AF ablation (Group 1) and 40 patients undergoing repeat ablation (group 2). Parasympathetic responses were found in all 32 Group 1 patients and in 75% of Group 2 patients. After VOM ethanol infusion, parasympathetic responses were abolished in all patients (both groups). There were no acute complications related to VOM ethanol infusion.\n\nConclusions\nThe VOM contains ICN that connect with the AV node and can trigger AF. Retrograde ethanol infusion in the VOM reliably eliminates local ICN responses. The VOM is a vascular route for ICN-targeting therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Báez-Escudero","given":"José L."},{"family":"Keida","given":"Takehiko"},{"family":"Dave","given":"Amish S."},{"family":"Okishige","given":"Kaoru"},{"family":"Valderrábano","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"Baez-Escudero2014","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","container-title-short":"J Am Coll Cardiol","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2014.01.032","ISSN":"0735-1097","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,13]]},"page":"1892-1901","PMCID":"PMC4035125","PMID":"24561151","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Ethanol infusion in the vein of Marshall leads to parasympathetic denervation of the human left atrium: Implications for atrial fibrillation","title-short":"Ethanol infusion in the vein of Marshall leads to parasympathetic denervation of the human left atrium","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035125/","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"Barber1985","abstract":"We have demonstrated previously that sympathetic and vagal afferents travel in an apical-to-basal course in the heart, and can be stimulated selectively with epicardial applications of bradykinin and nicotine, respectively. In this study we tested the hypothesis that transmural myocardial infarction interrupts sympathetic and vagal afferent fibers traveling through the infarction and produces regions of afferent denervation in areas apical to the infarction. In open-chest, chloralose-anesthetized dogs, transmural myocardial infarction was created by embolizing a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery with a vinyl latex solution that was injected directly into the artery and hardened rapidly. The transmural nature of the infarction was verified by the nitro blue tetrazolium staining technique for dehydrogenase enzymes. Epicardial applications of bradykinin (5 micrograms) and nicotine (50 micrograms) were used to stimulate chemically sensitive sympathetic and vagal afferent nerve endings, respectively. Twenty-nine dogs were studied before and 90 min after creation of transmural myocardial infarction. In 20 dogs, epicardial bradykinin applied before production of transmural myocardial infarction produced a maximal pressor response of 13 +/- 3 mm Hg 40 sec after application (p less than .01 vs preapplication values), while topical nicotine produced a maximal depressor response of 14 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than .01 vs preapplication values) 20 sec after application at all sites tested. Ninety minutes after production of transmural myocardial infarction, epicardial sites basal to the infarction continued to respond normally to both drugs, while sites within the area of infarction and apical to the area (noninfarcted myocardium) no longer showed a pressor response to topical bradykinin or a depressor response to topical nicotine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Barber","given":"M J"},{"family":"Mueller","given":"T M"},{"family":"Davies","given":"B G"},{"family":"Gill","given":"R M"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"D P"}],"citation-key":"Barber1985","container-title":"Circulation","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985",9]]},"page":"623-31","PMID":"4017213","title":"Interruption of sympathetic and vagal-mediated afferent responses by transmural myocardial infarction.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4017213","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"Bardy2005","abstract":"BACKGROUND Sudden death from cardiac causes remains a leading cause of death among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Treatment with amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proposed to improve the prognosis in such patients. METHODS We randomly assigned 2521 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 percent or less to conventional therapy for CHF plus placebo (847 patients), conventional therapy plus amiodarone (845 patients), or conventional therapy plus a conservatively programmed, shock-only, single-lead ICD (829 patients). Placebo and amiodarone were administered in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was death from any cause. RESULTS The median LVEF in patients was 25 percent; 70 percent were in NYHA class II, and 30 percent were in class III CHF. The cause of CHF was ischemic in 52 percent and nonischemic in 48 percent. The median follow-up was 45.5 months. There were 244 deaths (29 percent) in the placebo group, 240 (28 percent) in the amiodarone group, and 182 (22 percent) in the ICD group. As compared with placebo, amiodarone was associated with a similar risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.06; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P=0.53) and ICD therapy was associated with a decreased risk of death of 23 percent (0.77; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.007) and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population. Results did not vary according to either ischemic or nonischemic causes of CHF, but they did vary according to the NYHA class. CONCLUSIONS In patients with NYHA class II or III CHF and LVEF of 35 percent or less, amiodarone has no favorable effect on survival, whereas single-lead, shock-only ICD therapy reduces overall mortality by 23 percent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bardy","given":"Gust H."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kerry L."},{"family":"Mark","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Jeanne E."},{"family":"Packer","given":"Douglas L."},{"family":"Boineau","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Domanski","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Troutman","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"George"},{"family":"McNulty","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Clapp-Channing","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Davidson-Ray","given":"Linda D."},{"family":"Fraulo","given":"Elizabeth S."},{"family":"Fishbein","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Luceri","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Ip","given":"John H."}],"citation-key":"Bardy2005","container-title":"New England Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1056/nejmoa043399","ISSN":"0028-4793","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,20]]},"page":"225-237","PMID":"15659722","publisher":"New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM/MMS)","title":"Amiodarone or an Implantable Cardioverter–Defibrillator for Congestive Heart Failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15659722/","volume":"352"},
  {"id":"Barold2014","abstract":"In patients with pacemakers, hyperkalaemia causes three important abnormalities that usually become manifest when the K level exceeds 7 mEq/L: (i) widening of the paced QRS complex from delayed intraventricular conduction velocity, (ii) Increased atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds that may cause failure to capture. In this respect, the atria are more susceptible to loss of capture than the ventricles, and (iii) Increased latency (usually with ventricular pacing) manifested by a greater delay of the interval from the pacemaker stimulus to the onset of depolarization. First-degree ventricular pacemaker exit block may progress to second-degree Wenckebach (type I) exit block characterized by gradual prolongation of the interval from the pacemaker stimulus to the onset of the paced QRS complex ultimately resulting in an ineffectual stimulus. The disturbance may then progress to 2 : 1, 3 : 1 pacemaker exit block, etc., and eventually to complete exit block with total lack of capture. Ventricular undersensing is uncommonly observed because of frequent antibradycardia pacing. During managed ventricular pacing, hyperkalaemia-induced marked first-degree atrioventricular block may induce a pacemaker syndrome. With implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) oversensing of the paced or spontaneous T-wave may occur. The latter may cause inappropriate shocks. A raised impedance from the right ventricular coil to the superior vena cava coil may become an important sign of hyperkalaemia in the asymptomatic or the minimally symptomatic ICD patient.","author":[{"family":"Barold","given":"S.

  {"id":"Baron2018","abstract":"Circadian misalignment is hypothesized to contribute to increased diabetes and obesity among shift workers and individuals with late sleep timing. Accordingly, the goal of our study was to identify—among normal and overweight/obese adults—associations between circadian timing (dim light melatonin onset; DLMO) and circadian misalignment (the interval between DLMO and sleep onset) with metabolic disease risk. This was a secondary analysis of data from a larger study. Participants ages 18 to 50 years without depression, diabetes, or shift work, with sleep duration 6.5 h or more, completed the following evaluations: 7 days of wrist actigraphy, circadian timing assessment (DLMO), and a fasting blood draw to measure glucose and insulin and calculate the Homeostatic Model of Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Data were analyzed using correlation and regression analyses controlling for age, sex, DLMO, and sleep duration. Analyses were conducted for the entire sample (n = 54) and stratified by normal weight (n = 36) and overweight/obese groups (n = 18). Mean age was 26.4 years (SD = 7.1 years). Average sleep duration was 436.2 min (SD = 55.1 min), DLMO was 2250h (SD = 01:31), and interval between DLMO and sleep onset was 2 h 18 min (SD = 53 min). Average BMI was 24.3 kg/m2 (SD = 4.5 kg/m2). Circadian timing and interval between DLMO and sleep onset were not associated with glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR in the main analyses. Among overweight/obese participants, a shorter interval between DLMO and sleep onset was associated with higher insulin (B[SE] = −5.12 [2.24], p = 0.04) and HOMA-IR (B[SE] = −1.32 [0.57], p = 0.04). Results of our multivariable model indicated that among overweight/obese participants, insulin was 5.1 pmol/L higher and HOMA was 1.3 µU/mL higher for every hour closer that sleep onset was to DLMO. The strengths of this study include the use of objective measures of circadian timing, but results should be considered hypothesis generating due to the small sample size and use of subgroup analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Kelly Glazer"},{"family":"Reid","given":"Kathryn J."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Lisa F."},{"family":"Attarian","given":"Hrayr"},{"family":"Zee","given":"Phyllis C."}],"citation-key":"Baron2018","container-title":"Journal of Biological Rhythms","DOI":"10.1177/0748730417745914","ISSN":"15524531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"76-83","PMID":"29262758","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc.","title":"Phase Relationship between DLMO and Sleep Onset and the Risk of Metabolic Disease among Normal Weight and Overweight/Obese Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730417745914","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"Bauer2006c","abstract":"Background: Decreased vagal activity after myocardial infarction results in reduced heart-rate variability and increased risk of death. To distinguish between vagal and sympathetic factors that affect heart-rate variability, we used a signal-processing algorithm to separately characterise deceleration and acceleration of heart rate. We postulated that diminished deceleration-related modulation of heart rate is an important prognostic marker. Our prospective hypotheses were that deceleration capacity is a better predictor of risk than left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN). Methods: We quantified heart rate deceleration capacity by assessing 24-h Holter recordings from a post-infarction cohort in Munich (n=1455). We blindly validated the prognostic power of deceleration capacity in post-infarction populations in London, UK (n=656), and Oulu, Finland (n=600). We tested our hypotheses by assessment of the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). Findings: During a median follow-up of 24 months, 70 people died in the Munich cohort and 66 in the London cohort. The Oulu cohort was followed-up for 38 months and 77 people died. In the London cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·80 (SD 0·03) compared with 0·67 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·69 (0·04) for SDNN. In the Oulu cohort, mean AUC of deceleration capacity was 0·74 (0·03) compared with 0·60 (0·04) for LVEF and 0·64 (0·03) for SDNN (p<0·0001 for all comparisons). Stratification by dichotomised deceleration capacity was especially powerful in patients with preserved LVEF (p<0·0001 in all cohorts). Interpretation: Impaired heart rate deceleration capacity is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and is more accurate than LVEF and the conventional measures of heart-rate variability. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"Bauer2017","abstract":"Despite major advances in medical therapies late mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) is still high. A substantial proportion of post-MI patients die from sudden cardiac death. Prophylactic implantable-cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been established for post-MI patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%). However, most patients who die after MI have an LVEF > 35%. For this large group of patients, no specific prophylactic strategies exist. There is strong evidence that measures of cardiac autonomic dysfunction after MI provide important prognostic information in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF. Combinations of autonomic markers can identify high-risk patients after MI with LVEF > 35% whose prognosis is equally worse than that of patients with LVEF ≤ 35%. The ongoing REFINE-ICD (NCT00673842) and SMART-MI trials (NCT02594488) test different preventive strategies in high-risk post-MI patients with cardiac autonomic dysfunction and LVEF 36–50%. While REFINE-ICD follows the traditional concept of ICD-implantation, SMART-MI uses implantable cardiac monitors with remote monitoring capabilities to sensitively detect asymptomatic, but prognostically relevant arrhythmias that could trigger specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"Bauer2017","container-title":"International Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.087","ISSN":"18741754","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"19-21","PMID":"28343763","title":"Identifying high-risk post-infarction patients by autonomic testing — Below the tip of the iceberg","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.087","volume":"237"},

It accounts for 1-2% of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but arguably is under-recognised rather than rare.

Therapeutic endoscopy can control the bleeding in 90% of patients while angiography is being accepted as a valuable alternative to endoscopy for inaccessible lesions. Currently, surgical intervention is kept for failure of therapeutic endoscopic or angiographic interventions and it should be guided by pre-operative localisation.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Advances in endoscopy have increased the detection of Dieulafoy's lesions and decreased the mortality from 80% to 8.6%.

  {"id":"Bazan2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The clinical yield of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter (AF) is limited by a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AFib) in the long term. Among other acknowledged variables, the association of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could favor incomplete arrhythmia control in this setting. We assessed the impact of CPAP in reducing the occurrence of AFib after CTI ablation.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients with AF who were undergoing CTI ablation were screened for OSA. Relationship of the following variables with the occurrence of AFib during follow-up (12 months) was investigated: CPAP initiation, hypertension, BMI, underlying structural heart disease, left atrial diameter, and AFib documentation prior to ablation.\nRESULTS: We prospectively included 56 patients (mean age: 66 (± 11) years; 12 female patients), of whom 46 (82%) had OSA and 25 (45%) had severe OSA. Twenty-one patients (38%) had AFib during follow-up after CTI ablation. Both freedom from AFib prior to ablation and CPAP initiation in those patients without previously documented AFib at inclusion were associated with a reduction of AFib episodes during follow-up (P = .019 and P = .025, respectively). Inversely, CPAP was not protective from AFib recurrence when this arrhythmia was documented prior to ablation (P = .25).\nCONCLUSIONS: OSA is a prevalent condition in patients with AF. Treatment with CPAP is associated with a lower incidence of newly diagnosed AFib after CTI ablation. Screening for OSA in patients with AF appears to be a reasonable clinical strategy.","author":[{"family":"Bazan","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Grau","given":"Nuria"},{"family":"Valles","given":"Ermengol"},{"family":"Felez","given":"Miquel"},{"family":"Sanjuas","given":"Carles"},{"family":"Cainzos-Achirica","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Benito","given":"Begoña"},{"family":"Jauregui-Abularach","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Gea","given":"Joaquim"},{"family":"Bruguera-Cortada","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Marti-Almor","given":"Julio"}],"citation-key":"Bazan2013","container-title":"Chest","container-title-short":"Chest","DOI":"10.1378/chest.12-0697","ISSN":"1931-3543","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"1277-1283","PMID":"23117936","source":"PubMed","title":"Obstructive sleep apnea in patients with typical atrial flutter: prevalence and impact on arrhythmia control outcome","title-short":"Obstructive sleep apnea in patients with typical atrial flutter","type":"article-journal","volume":"143"},

  {"id":"Beard2011","abstract":"Based on observations that as cardiac output (as determined by an artificial pump) was experimentally increased the right atrial pressure decreased, Arthur Guyton and coworkers proposed an interpretation that right atrial pressure represents a back pressure restricting venous return (equal to cardiac output in steady state). The idea that right atrial pressure is a back pressure limiting cardiac output and the associated idea that \"venous recoil\" does work to produce flow have confused physiologists and clinicians for decades because Guyton's interpretation interchanges independent and dependent variables. Here Guyton's model and data are reanalyzed to clarify the role of arterial and right atrial pressures and cardiac output and to clearly delineate that cardiac output is the independent (causal) variable in the experiments. Guyton's original mathematical model is used with his data to show that a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure and decrease in right atrial pressure with increasing cardiac output is due to a blood volume shift into the systemic arterial circulation from the systemic venous circulation. This is because Guyton's model assumes a constant blood volume in the systemic circulation. The increase in right atrial pressure observed when cardiac output decreases in a closed circulation with constant resistance and capacitance is due to the redistribution of blood volume and not because right atrial pressure limits venous return. Because Guyton's venous return curves have generated much confusion and little clarity, we suggest that the concept and previous interpretations of venous return be removed from educational materials","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Beard","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Feigl","given":"Eric O."}],"citation-key":"Beard2011","container-title":"AJP: Heart and Circulatory Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.00228.2011","ISBN":"1522-1539","ISSN":"0363-6135","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"page":"H629-H633","PMID":"21666119","publisher":"American Physiological Society Bethesda, MD","title":"Understanding Guyton's venous return curves","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpheart.00228.2011","volume":"301"},
  {"id":"Beau1993","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Downregulation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density does not occur in a spatially uniform distribution in patients with congestive heart failure. Rather, it results primarily from loss of receptors in the subendocardium. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-receptors have been found to be downregulated selectively. These observations suggest that considerable transmural heterogeneity in the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes exists in the failing human heart. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites to measure the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in transmural sections of left ventricular myocardium obtained from cardiac transplant patients with ischemic (n = 13) and idiopathic dilated (n = 12) cardiomyopathy and from 4 subjects with no history of cognitive heart failure. Analysis of radioligand binding isotherms revealed a significant reduction in total beta-adrenergic receptor density in hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (20.3 +/- 1.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively, versus 40.0 +/- 11.4 in control subjects; P < .01 for both). Loss of the beta 1-subtype accounted for 86% of the total reduction in beta-receptor density in failing hearts. Despite the significant decreases in overall tissue receptor content, the densities of total beta-receptors and beta-receptor subtypes in subepicardial myocytes were equivalent in failing and control hearts. However, in contrast to control hearts, in which the transmural distribution of total and beta 1-receptors was uniform (endocardial: epicardial receptor density ratios, 0.97 +/- 0.14 and 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively), hearts of patients with ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy had significantly lower total beta-receptor and beta 1-receptor densities in the subendocardium (ratios, 0.66 +/- 0.06 and 0.46 +/- 0.09 for total and beta 1-receptors, respectively, in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 0.60 +/- 0.08 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 in dilated cardiomyopathy; P < .001 for all values compared with a ratio of 1). Thus, beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratios were markedly decreased in the subendocardium of ischemic and idiopathic dilated left ventricles compared with control hearts.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant transmural gradient in the density of myocardial beta 1-adrenergic receptors exists in the hearts of patients with ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, resulting in a markedly altered beta 1: beta 2 receptor density ratio in the subendocardium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Beau","given":"Scott L"},{"family":"Tolley","given":"Timothy K"},{"family":"Saffitz","given":"Jeffrey E"}],"citation-key":"Beau1993","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.88.6.2501","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",12]]},"page":"2501-2509","PMID":"7902783","title":"Heterogeneous transmural distribution of β-adrenergic receptor subtypes in failing human hearts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7902783","volume":"88"},
  {"id":"Beaumont2013","abstract":"The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56%) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25%; stellate ganglion alone: 27%; both: 48%). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function.

  {"id":"Belardinelli1983","abstract":"We investigated the effects of adenosine and isoproterenol on enzymatically dispersed ventricular myocytes from bovine and guinea pig hearts. Intracellular stimulation of relaxed myocytes with regular striation patterns and normal resting potential resulted in action potentials with full plateaus accompanied by contractions. Adenosine in concentrations up to 0.2 mM had no significant effect on any of the action potential parameters or on the basal contractility. In contrast, in the same cells, adenosine effectively antagonized the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol. Isoproterenol (1-10 nM) prolonged the action potentials by 34-41%, displaced the plateau to more positive potentials, and caused a 3-fold increase in the extent of myocyte sarcomere shortening. In the presence of adenosine (5-50 μM), isoproterenol increased the action potential duration by only 8-9%, the shift of the plateau was nearly abolished, and the increase in the extent of myocyte sarcomere shortening was less than 10%. In some of the myocytes, isoproterenol (1-10 nM) induced depolarizing afterpotentials accompanied by aftercontractions. The afterdepolarizations occasionally reached threshold resulting in triggered sustained rhythmic activity. Adenosine (20-50 μM) not only reduced the amplitude of the afterdepolarizations and aftercontractions, but also abolished the sustained rhythmic activity. We conclude, first, that isolated ventricular myocytes respond to isoproterenol and adenosine; second, that adenosine has no direct effect, but effectively antagonizes the stimulatory actions of isoproterenol; third, that findings are consistent with the ones reported for multicellular ventricular preparations; fourth, that adenosine concentrations required to attenuate the actions of isoproterenol are in the range of adenosine concentrations released by cardiac cells when oxygen availability is limited and/or demand is increased; and fifth, that endogenously released adenosine may modulate the electrophysiological and contractile effects of catecholamines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Belardinelli","given":"L."},{"family":"Isenberg","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"Belardinelli1983","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/01.RES.53.3.287","ISSN":"00097330","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"page":"287-297","PMID":"6883651","title":"Actions of adenosine and isoproterenol on isolated mammalian ventricular myocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.RES.53.3.287","volume":"53"},

After adjusting for age and other risk factors for atrial fibrillation, men had a 1.5 times greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation than women. In the full multivariable model, the odds ratio (OR) of atrial fibrillation for each decade of advancing age was 2.1 for men and 2.2 for women (P < .0001). In addition, after multivariable adjustment, diabetes (OR, 1.4 for men and 1.6 for women), hypertension (OR, 1.5 for men and 1.4 for women), congestive heart failure (OR, 4.5 for men and 5.9 for women), and valve disease (OR, 1.8 for men and 3.4 for women) were significantly associated with risk for atrial fibrillation in both sexes. Myocardial infarction (OR, 1.4) was significantly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation in men. Women were significantly more likely than men to have valvular heart disease as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. The multivariable models were largely unchanged after eliminating subjects with valvular heart disease.\nCONCLUSION: In addition to intrinsic cardiac causes such as valve disease and congestive heart failure, risk factors for cardiovascular disease also predispose to atrial fibrillation. Modification of risk factors for cardiovascular disease may have the added benefit of diminishing the incidence of atrial fibrillation.","author":[{"family":"Benjamin","given":"E.

  {"id":"Benjamin2018c","abstract":"Each year, the American Heart Association (AHA), in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies, brings together in a single document the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and the cardiovascular risk factors listed in the AHA's My Life Check - Life's Simple 7 (Figure 1 ), which include core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke produce immense health and economic burdens in the United States and globally. The Update also presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease [CHD], heart failure [HF], valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Since 2007, the annual versions of the Statistical Update have been cited >20 000 times in the literature. From January to July 2017 alone, the 2017 Statistical Update was accessed >106 500 times. Each annual version of the Statistical Update undergoes revisions to include the newest nationally representative data, add additional relevant published scientific findings, remove older information, add new sections or chapters, and increase the number of ways to access and use the assembled information. This year-long process, which begins as soon as the previous Statistical Update is published, is performed by the AHA Statistics Committee faculty volunteers and staff and government agency partners. This year's edition includes new data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, new metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, new information on stroke in young adults, an enhanced focus on underserved and minority populations, a substantively expanded focus on the global burden of CVD, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals.

  {"id":"Benjamin2023","abstract":"Only modest attention has been paid to the contributions of social determinants of health to atrial fibrillation (AF) risk factors, diagnosis, symptoms, management, and outcomes. The diagnosis of AF provides unique challenges exacerbated by the arrhythmia’s often paroxysmal nature and individuals’ disparate access to health care and technologies that facilitate detection. Social determinants of health affect access to care and management decisions for AF, increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes among individuals who experience systemic disadvantages. Developing effective approaches to address modifiable social determinants of health requires research to eliminate the substantive inequities in health care delivery and outcomes in AF.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened an expert panel to identify major knowledge gaps and research opportunities in the field of social determinants of AF. The workshop addressed the following social determinants: (1) socioeconomic status and access to care; (2) health literacy; (3) race, ethnicity, and racism; (4) sex and gender; (5) shared decision-making in systemically disadvantaged populations; and (6) place, including rurality, neighborhood, and community. Many individuals with AF have multiple adverse social determinants, which may cluster in the individual and in systemically disadvantaged places (eg, rural locations, urban neighborhoods). Cumulative disadvantages may accumulate over the life course and contribute to inequities in the diagnosis, management, and outcomes in AF.Workshop participants identified multiple critical research questions and approaches to catalyze social determinants of health research that address the distinctive aspects of AF. The long-term aspiration of this work is to eradicate the substantive inequities in AF diagnosis, management, and outcomes across populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Emelia J."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Kevin L."},{"family":"Go","given":"Alan S."},{"family":"Desvigne-Nickens","given":"Patrice"},{"family":"Albert","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"Alanna M."},{"family":"Essien","given":"Utibe R."},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Inmaculada"},{"family":"Hills","given":"Mellanie True"},{"family":"Kershaw","given":"Kiarri N."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Phillip D."},{"family":"Magnani","given":"Jared W."},{"family":"Matlock","given":"Daniel D."},{"family":"O’Brien","given":"Emily C."},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Carlos J."},{"family":"Russo","given":"Andrea M."},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z."},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Lawton S."},{"family":"Al-Khatib","given":"Sana M."}],"citation-key":"Benjamin2023","container-title":"JAMA Cardiology","container-title-short":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2022.4091","ISSN":"2380-6583","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"182-191","source":"Silverchair","title":"Transforming Atrial Fibrillation Research to Integrate Social Determinants of Health: A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop Report","title-short":"Transforming Atrial Fibrillation Research to Integrate Social Determinants of Health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2022.4091","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"Benschop1994","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute mental stress evokes responses in the cardiovascular and the immune systems. In particular, the subset of natural killer (NK) cells is found to be responsive to mental stress. The role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in these processes in the subject of this investigation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n = 31) were subjected to two consecutive mental tasks. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg) or a placebo group. The capsules were ingested 1 hour before the tasks. The tasks evoked sympathetic responses, as indicated by an increase in heart rate and a decrease in the preejection period. These effects were abolished under beta-blockade, indicating that effective beta-blockade was achieved. In the immune system, significant increases were found for the number of NK cells and NK cell activity in the placebo group; these increases were absent in the propranolol group. In addition, an increase in all lymphocyte subsets was observed in subjects who had ingested propranolol. This increase, however, was also observed in subjects who had received propranolol but had not performed the tasks, indicating that these non-subset-specific increases in lymphocytes were a side effect of the beta-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: Mental stress induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with concomitant increases in the number of NK cells in the circulation. These changes were inhibited by propranolol, indicating that stress-induced increases in the number and activity of NK cells in the circulation are controlled by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Benschop","given":"R J"},{"family":"Nieuwenhuis","given":"E E"},{"family":"Tromp","given":"E A"},{"family":"Godaert","given":"G L"},{"family":"Ballieux","given":"R E"},{"family":"Doornen","given":"L J","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Benschop1994","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.89.2.762","ISBN":"0009-7322 (Print)","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",2,12]]},"page":"762-769","PMID":"7508828","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","title":"Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on immunologic and cardiovascular changes induced by mental stress.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7508828","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"Bentzer2016","abstract":"IMPORTANCE Fluid overload occurring as a consequence of overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may adversely affect outcome in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients. Therefore, following the initial fluid resuscitation, it is important to identify which patients will benefit from further fluid administration. OBJECTIVE To identify predictors of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of inadequate organ perfusion. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to June 2016) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to predict fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adult patients who were defined as having refractory hypotension, signs of organ hypoperfusion, or both. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. A bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model was used to pool the sensitivities, specificities, and LRs across studies. RESULTS A total of 50 studies (N = 2260 patients) were analyzed. In all studies, indices were measured before assessment of fluid responsiveness. The mean prevalence of fluid responsiveness was 50% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Findings on physical examination were not predictive of fluid responsiveness with LRs and 95% CIs for each finding crossing 1.0. A low central venous pressure (CVP) (mean threshold <8 mm Hg) was associated with fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.4-4.6]; pooled specificity, 76%), but a CVP greater than the threshold made fluid responsiveness less likely (negative LR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.39-0.65]; pooled sensitivity, 62%). Respiratory variation in vena cava diameter measured by ultrasound (distensibility index >15%) predicted fluid responsiveness in a subgroup of patients without spontaneous respiratory efforts (positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 1.1-27]; pooled specificity, 85%). Patients with less vena cava distensibility were not as likely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08-0.87]; pooled sensitivity, 77%). Augmentation of cardiac output or related parameters following passive leg raising predicted fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 11 [95% CI, 7.6-17]; pooled specificity, 92%). Conversely, the lack of an increase in cardiac output with passive leg raising identified patients unlikely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.22]; pooled sensitivity, 88%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Passive leg raising followed by measurement of cardiac output or related parameters may be the most useful test for predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adults. The usefulness of respiratory variation in the vena cava requires confirmatory studies.","author":[{"family":"Bentzer","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Griesdale","given":"Donald E."},{"family":"Boyd","given":"John"},{"family":"MacLean","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Sirounis","given":"Demetrios"},{"family":"Ayas","given":"Najib T."}],"citation-key":"Bentzer2016","container-title":"JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2016.12310","ISBN":"0098-7484 (Print)\\r0098-7484 (Linking)","ISSN":"15383598","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1298-1309","PMID":"27673307","title":"Will this hemodynamically unstable patient respond to a bolus of intravenous fluids?","type":"article-journal","volume":"316"},

Objective: To determine whether mortality and recurrent infarction are reduced by treatment of depression and LPSS with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), supplemented with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant when indicated, in patients enrolled within 28 days after MI. Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted from October 1996 to April 2001 in 2481 MI patients (1084 women, 1397 men) enrolled from 8 clinical centers. Major or minor depression was diagnosed by modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and severity by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD); LPSS was determined by the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Social Support Instrument (ESSI). Random allocation was to usual medical care or CBT-based psychosocial intervention. Intervention: Cognitive behavior therapy was initiated at a median of 17 days after the index MI for a median of 11 individual sessions throughout 6 months, plus group therapy when feasible, with SSRIs for patients scoring higher than 24 on the HRSD or having a less than 50% reduction in Beck Depression Inventory scores after 5 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Composite primary end point of death or recurrent MI; secondary outcomes included change in HRSD (for depression) or ESSI scores (for LPSS) at 6 months. Results: Improvement in psychosocial outcomes at 6 months favored treatment: mean (SD) change in HRSD score, -10.1 (7.8) in the depression and psychosocial intervention group vs -8.4 (7.7) in the depression and usual care group (P<.001); mean (SD) change in ESSI score, 5.1 (5.9) in the LPSS and psychosocial intervention group vs 3.4 (6.0) in the LPSS and usual care group (P<.001). After an average follow-up of 29 months, there was no significant difference in event-free survival between usual care (75.9%) and psychosocial intervention (75.8%). There were also no differences in survival between the psychosocial intervention and usual care arms in any of the 3 psychosocial risk groups (depression, LPSS, and depression and LPSS patients). Conclusions: The intervention did not increase event-free survival. The intervention improved depression and social isolation, although the relative improvement in the psychosocial intervention group compared with the usual care group was less than expected due to substantial improvement in usual care patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Berkman","given":"Lisa F."},{"family":"Blumenthal","given":"James"},{"family":"Burg","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Catellier","given":"Diane"},{"family":"Cowan","given":"Marie J."},{"family":"Czajkowski","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"De Busk","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hosking","given":"James"},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Kaufmann","given":"Peter G."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Norman","given":"James"},{"family":"Powell","given":"Lynda H."},{"family":"Raczynski","given":"James M."},{"family":"Schneiderman","given":"Neil"},{"literal":"Raczynski"}],"citation-key":"Berkman2003","container-title":"Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.289.23.3106","ISSN":"00987484","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6,18]]},"page":"3106-3116","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Effects of Treating Depression and Low Perceived Social Support on Clinical Events after Myocardial Infarction: The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) Randomized Trial","type":"article-journal","volume":"289"},

  {"id":"Berman2010","abstract":"Most deaths in the first 30 days after cardiac transplantation are due to failure of the donor heart, often with the clinical picture of right ventricular failure. Indeed, there is a significant reduction in contractility of the human donor heart and loss of contractile reserve before and soon after transplantation. This myocardial insult appears in association with brain death in the donor and follows a \"catecholamine storm\" associated with a rapidly rising intracranial pressure. Microscopy of the myocardium in organ donors shows a picture typical of catecholamine-induced injury and similar to changes found in endomyocardial specimens of stress cardiomyopathy (catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). There are 3 common features between stress cardiomyopathy and the heart of a brain-dead donor: exposure of the heart to unusually high catecholamine levels, ventricular dysfunction, and prompt recovery. Stress cardiomyopathy is a temporary myocardial dysfunction that has been described after sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic head injury, pheochromocytoma, acute emotional distress, exogenous administration of catecholamines, and non-related surgery. Given the common features of this catecholamine-mediated myocardial insult, we ask if brain-dead donor heart dysfunction is an extreme variant of stress cardiomyopathy? And, if so is it, like stress cardiomyopathy, reversible?

  {"id":"Bernal2015","abstract":"Summary Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernal","given":"William"},{"family":"Jalan","given":"Rajiv"},{"family":"Quaglia","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Simpson","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Wendon","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Burroughs","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Bernal2015","container-title":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00309-8","ISBN":"978-1-60761-865-2","ISSN":"01406736","issue":"10003","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10]]},"page":"1576-1587","PMID":"22750750","title":"Acute-on-chronic liver failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/","volume":"386"},

  {"id":"Bettoni2002b","abstract":"BACKGROUND Mechanisms favoring the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) are complex and poorly defined. This study was designed to analyze dynamic changes in autonomic tone preceding the onset of PAF in a large group of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS Holter tapes from 77 unselected consecutive patients (63 men and 14 women aged 58+/-12 years) with PAF were analyzed. A total of 147 episodes of sustained AF (>30 minutes) were recorded and submitted to time-domain and frequency-domain heart rate variability analyses; 6 periods were studied using repeated measures ANOVA: the 24-hour period, the hour preceding PAF, and the 20 minutes before PAF divided into four 5-minute periods. In the time-domain analyses, a linear decrease in mean RR interval from 925+/-16 to 906+/-16 ms (P<0.0002) was observed before the onset of PAF, together with a significant increase in the standard deviation of NN intervals from 65+/-4 to 70+/-4 ms (P<0.02). In the frequency-domain analyses, a significant increase in high-frequency (HF, HF-NU) components was observed before PAF (P<0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively), together with a progressive decrease in low-frequency components (LF, LF-NU) (P<0.0001 and P<0.004, respectively). The low/high frequency ratio showed a linear increase until 10 minutes before PAF, followed by a sharp decrease immediately before PAF, suggesting a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by a marked modulation toward vagal predominance. No difference was observed in these heart rate variability changes between patients with \"lone\" PAF and patients with structural heart disease. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of PAF greatly depends on variations of the autonomic tone, with a primary increase in adrenergic tone followed by an abrupt shift toward vagal predominance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bettoni","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"Bettoni2002b","container-title":"Circulation","ISSN":"1524-4539","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",6,11]]},"page":"2753-9","PMID":"12057990","title":"Autonomic tone variations before the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12057990","volume":"105"},

In addition, we will review the genetics of intermediate phenotypes for SCD such as coronary artery disease and electrocardiographic variables (QT interval, QRS duration, and RR interval). Finally, we will review rare and common variants that are associated with SCD in the general population and were identified from candidate gene analyses and GWAS. Our understanding of the genetics of SCD will improve by the use of next-generation sequencing/whole-exome sequencing as well as whole-genome sequencing which have the potential to discover unsuspected common and rare genetic variants that might be associated with SCD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bezzina","given":"Connie R."},{"family":"Lahrouchi","given":"Najim"},{"family":"Priori","given":"Silvia G."}],"citation-key":"Bezzina2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304030","ISBN":"1531-7080 (Electronic)\\r0268-4705 (Linking)","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"1919-1936","PMID":"26026997","title":"Genetics of Sudden Cardiac Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304030","volume":"116"},

Study Design and Setting We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all 291 Surgical and Medical Chairpersons across North America. We developed hypothetical study and authorship bylines with five authors varying the corresponding author as first or last author. Respondents reported their perceptions about the authors' roles in the study and the most prestigious authorship position. We used multinomial regression to explore the results. Results One hundred sixty-five chairpersons (response rate: 57%) completed our survey. When the first author was designated as corresponding author, most of the respondents assumed that this author had taken the lead in study design (55.3%) and analysis and interpretation of data (51.2%). When the last author (fifth) was designated as corresponding, perceptions of the first author's role in study concept and design (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.41) and analysis and interpretation of results (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.38) decreased significantly.

  {"id":"Bigger1992","abstract":"BACKGROUND We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to establish the associations between six frequency domain measures of heart period variability (HPV) and mortality during 4 years of follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS Each measure of HPV had a significant and at least moderately strong univariate association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death. Power in the lower-frequency bands--ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) power--had stronger associations with all three mortality end points than power in the higher-frequency bands--low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression model significantly improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established postinfarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bigger","given":"J.

We evaluated the effect on survival of the prophylactic implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators in such patients at the time of coronary-artery bypass surgery. METHODS Over the course of five years, 37 clinical centers screened all patients who were scheduled for elective coronary bypass surgery. Patients were eligible for the trial if they were less than 80 years old, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 0.36, and had abnormalities on signal-averaged electrocardiograms. We identified 1422 eligible patients, enrolled 1055, and randomly assigned 900 to therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (446 patients) or to the control group (454 patients). The primary end point of the study was overall mortality, and the two groups were compared in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS The base-line characteristics of the two groups were similar. During an average follow-up of 32+/-16 months, there were 101 deaths in the defibrillator group (71 from cardiac causes) and 95 in the control group (72 from cardiac causes). The hazard ratio for death from any cause was 1.07 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.42; P=0.64). There was no statistically significant interaction between defibrillator therapy and any of 10 preselected base-line covariates.

  {"id":"Billman2011a","abstract":"Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the \"Physician's Pulse Watch\" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Billman","given":"George E."}],"citation-key":"Billman2011a","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","DOI":"10.3389/fphys.2011.00086","ISBN":"1664-042X (Electronic)\\r1664-042X (Linking)","ISSN":"1664042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"PMID":"22144961","title":"Heart rate variability - A historical perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.frontiersin.org","volume":"2 NOV"},
  {"id":"Billman2013","abstract":"Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R–R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the “power”) of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04–0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15–0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24–1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to “sympathetic dominance” and decreases in this index correspond to a “parasympathetic dominance.” Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Billman","given":"George E."}],"citation-key":"Billman2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","DOI":"10.3389/fphys.2013.00026","ISBN":"1664-042X","ISSN":"1664042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"26","PMID":"23431279","publisher":"Billman","title":"The LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.frontiersin.org","volume":"4 FEB"},

  {"id":"Binder2006","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship among age, septal morphological subtype, and presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-associated myofilament mutations.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive mutation analysis of the 8 HCM susceptibility genes that encode the myofilaments of the cardiac sarcomere was performed previously in 382 unrelated patients with HCM. Blinded to genotype status, we used echocardiography to characterize the left ventricular morphological features. Multivariate regression was used to assess the relationship among morphological subtypes, clinical data, and genetic variables.\nRESULTS: The mean +/- SD age of the patients was 41.6+/-19.0 years, with 126 patients 50 years or older at initial diagnosis. The septal morphological subtype was sigmold in 181 (47%), reverse in 132 (35%), apical variant in 37 (10%), and neutral in 32 (8%). The HCM-associated myofilament mutations were Identified in 143 patients (37%). Multivariate analysis showed that the reverse curvature septal morphological subtype was a strong predictor of genotype-positive status (odds ratio, 21; P<.001). Overall, the yield of HCM genetic testing was 79% in the setting of reverse curvature HCM but only 8% in sigmold septal HCM.\nCONCLUSION: In stark contrast to HCM in young patients, elderly patients with HCM display a predominantly sigmoid septal morphological subtype and uncommonly have perturbations of known HCM susceptibility genes. Independent of age, septal morphological subtype strongly predicts the presence or absence of HCM-associated myofilament mutations and may enable echocardiography-guided genetic testing for HCM.","author":[{"family":"Binder","given":"Josepha"},{"family":"Ommen","given":"Steve R."},{"family":"Gersh","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Van Driest","given":"Sara L."},{"family":"Tajik","given":"A.

Although the therapeutic approach of HRVB is promising in various stress-related disorders, it has only been offered on a regular basis in a few mental health treatment settings. AIM To analyse the efficacy of HRV biofeedback as an additional psychophysiological treatment for depression and PTSD. METHOD Systematic review with search terms HRV, biofeedback, PTSD, depression, panic disorder and anxiety disorder. RESULTS Our search of the literature yielded 789 studies. After critical appraisal using the GRADE method, we selected 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 relevant studies. The RCTs with control groups 'treatment as usual' and muscle relaxation training revealed significant clinical efficacy and better results than codntrol conditions after 4 to 8 weeks training. CONCLUSION Although this systematic review shows the popularity of HRV in literature, it does not indicate that HRVB really has been reviewed systematically. Significant outcomes of this limited number of randomised studies indicate there may be a clinical improvement when HRVB training is integrated into treatment of PTSD and depression, particularly when this integration procedure is combined with psychotherapy. More research needs to be done with larger groups and further efforts are needed to integrate HRVB into treatment of stress-related disorders in psychiatry. Future research also needs to focus on the psychophysiological mechanisms involved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Blase","given":"K L"},{"family":"Dijke","given":"A","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Cluitmans","given":"P J M"},{"family":"Vermetten","given":"E"}],"citation-key":"Blase2010","container-title":"The American Journal of Psychiatriy","ISBN":"0303-7339","ISSN":"0303-7339","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"292-300","PMID":"27075221","title":"Efficacy of HRV-biofeedback as additional treatment of depression and PTSD.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075221","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"Blume2018","abstract":"Verifying that a statistically significant result is scientifically meaningful is not only good scientific practice, it is a natural way to control the Type I error rate. Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value—a second-generation p-value (pδ)–that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pδ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pδ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 < pδ < 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Blume","given":"Jeffrey D."},{"family":"D’Agostino McGowan","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"William D."},{"family":"Greevy","given":"Robert A."}],"citation-key":"Blume2018","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0188299","editor":[{"family":"Smalheiser","given":"Neil R."}],"ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,22]]},"page":"e0188299","PMID":"29565985","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Second-generation p-values: Improved rigor, reproducibility, & transparency in statistical analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188299","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Bogeholz2015","abstract":"Background - The Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) has been implied to cause arrhythmias. To date, information on the role of NCX in arrhythmogenesis derived from models with increased NCX expression, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which NCX exerts its potentially proarrhythmic effect, ie, by promoting early afterdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) or both, is unknown. Methods and Results - We investigated isolated cardiomyocytes from a murine model with heterozygous knockout of NCX (hetKO) using the patch clamp and Ca 2+ imaging techniques. Action potential duration was shorter in hetKO with I Ktot not being increased. The rate of spontaneous Ca 2+ release events and the rate of DADs were unaltered; however, DADs had lower amplitude in hetKO. A DAD triggered a spontaneous action potential significantly less often in hetKO when compared with wild-type. The occurrence of EADs was also drastically reduced in hetKO. I Ca activity was reduced in hetKO, an effect that was abolished in the presence of the Ca 2+ buffer BAPTA. Conclusions - Genetic suppression of NCX reduces both EADs and DADs. The following molecular mechanisms apply: (1) Although the absolute number of DADs is unaffected, an impaired translation of DADs into spontaneous action potentials results from a reduced DAD amplitude. (2) EADs are reduced in absolute number of occurrence, which is presumably a consequence of shortened action potential duration because of reduced NCX activity but also reduced I Ca the latter possibly being caused by a direct modulation of Ca 2+ -dependent I Ca inhibition by reduced NCX activity. This is the first study to demonstrate that genetic inhibition of NCX protects against afterdepolarizations and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bögeholz","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Pauls","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"B.

  {"id":"Bogle2018","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Vital exhaustion (VE), a construct defined as lack of energy, increased fatigue and irritability, and feelings of demoralisation, has been associated with cardiovascular events. We sought to examine the relation between VE and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. METHODS The ARIC Study is a predominately biracial cohort of men and women, aged 45-64 at baseline, initiated in 1987 through random sampling in four US communities. VE was measured using the Maastricht questionnaire between 1990 and 1992 among 13 923 individuals. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the hazard of out-of-hospital SCD across tertiles of VE scores. RESULTS Through 2012, 457 SCD cases, defined as a sudden pulseless condition presumed due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a previously stable individual, were identified in ARIC by physician record review. Adjusting for age, sex and race/centre, participants in the highest VE tertile had an increased risk of SCD (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.87), but these findings did not remain significant after adjustment for established cardiovascular disease risk factors (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20).

We aimed to assess the clinical and immune effects of direct-acting antiviral treatment. Methods We performed a prospective study of 64 patients with HCV infection with circulating cryoglobulins receiving direct-acting antiviral therapy at a single center in Barcelona, Spain, from January 2014 through April 2016. Patients were classified as having CV (n = 35) or asymptomatic circulating cryoglobulins (ACC, n = 29). Clinical response was considered complete if a patient's Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (version 3) was 0, or if all affected organs improved 12 weeks after the end of therapy. A complete immunologic response (CIR) was defined as no detection of circulating cryoglobulins and normalized levels of complement and/or rheumatoid factor. Results Clinical manifestations of CV included purpura (65%), weakness (70%), arthralgia (31%), myalgia (20%), peripheral neuropathy (50%), and renal involvement (20%). At baseline, patients with CV had significantly higher levels of rheumatoid factor and lower levels of C4 complement than patients with ACC, whereas cryocrits were similar between groups (3.2% vs 2.6%). Overall, 60 patients (94%) had a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. Among patients with CV, the median Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (version 3) decreased from 9 (range, 2–31) to 3 (range, 0–12) (P < .001). Twenty-five patients with CV (71%) achieved a complete clinical response. Immune-suppressive therapy was reduced for 4 of 13 patients and withdrawn for 6 of 13. Overall, 48% of patients achieved a CIR. A low baseline cryocrit level (<2.7%) was the only factor associated with CIR (odds ratio, 9.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.2–44; P = .03). Conclusions Viral eradication was associated with clinical improvement in most patients with CV. Markers of immune activation, including circulating cryoglobulins, persisted in 52% of patients with CV or ACC, despite a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. A longer follow-up period after viral eradication might be necessary to ensure a normal immune response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonacci","given":"Martín"},{"family":"Lens","given":"Sabela"},{"family":"Londoño","given":"María Carlota"},{"family":"Mariño","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Cid","given":"Maria C"},{"family":"Ramos-Casals","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Sánchez-Tapias","given":"Jose María"},{"family":"Forns","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Hernández-Rodríguez","given":"José"}],"citation-key":"Bonacci2017","container-title":"Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cgh.2016.09.158","ISBN":"1067-991X","ISSN":"15427714","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"575-583.e1","PMID":"27725289","title":"Virologic, Clinical, and Immune Response Outcomes of Patients With Hepatitis C Virus–Associated Cryoglobulinemia Treated With Direct-Acting Antivirals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2016.09.158","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"Bonnemeier2003","abstract":"Circadian Profile of Heart Rate Variability. INTRODUCTION: Although heart rate variability (HRV) has been established as a tool to study cardiac autonomic activity, almost no data are available on the circadian patterns of HRV in healthy subjects aged 20 to 70 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 166 healthy volunteers (81 women and 85 men; age 42 +/- 15 years, range 20-70) without evidence of cardiac disease. Time-domain HRV parameters were determined from 24-hour Holter monitoring and calculated as hourly mean values and mean 24-hour values. All volunteers were fully mobile, awoke around 7 A.M., and had 6 to 8 hours of sleep. Circadian profiles of vagus-associated HRV parameters revealed a marked day-night pattern, with a peak at nighttime and a plateau at daytime. The characteristic nocturnal peak and the day-night amplitude diminished with aging by decade. Estimates of overall HRV (geometric triangular index [TI], SD of NN intervals [SDNN]) and long-term components of HRV (SD of the averages of NN intervals for all 5-min segments [SDANN]) were low at nighttime and increased in the morning hours. There was a significant decline of 24-hour values of all HRV parameters (P < 0.001) and a strong negative correlation (P < 0.001) with increasing age. Mean 24-hour RR interval (P < 0.001), SDNN, mean SD of NN intervals for all 5-minute intervals (SDNNi), and SDANN (all P < 0.01) were significantly higher in men. Younger men also exhibited significantly higher values for vagus-associated parameters (root mean square successive difference [rMSSD], P < 0.05; SDNNi, P < 0.01); however, gender differences diminished with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Normal aging is associated with a constant decline of cardiac vagal modulation due to a significant decrease of nocturnal parasympathetic activity. The significant gender-related difference of HRV decreases with aging. These findings emphasize the need to determine age-, gender-, and nycthemeral-dependent normal ranges for HRV assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonnemeier","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Wiegand","given":"Uwe K.H."},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Kluge","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Katus","given":"Hugo A"},{"family":"Richardt","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Potratz","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"Bonnemeier2003","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1540-8167.2003.03078.x","ISBN":"1045-3873 (Print)","ISSN":"10453873","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",8]]},"page":"791-799","PMID":"12890036","title":"Circadian profile of cardiac autonomic nervous modulation in healthy subjects: Differing effects of aging and gender on heart rate variability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12890036","volume":"14"},

DESIGN: Open-label clinical trial consisting of three treatment cycles (14 days of drug therapy, and 14 days off drug) and an additional 40-week follow-up by chart review. SETTING: Nine clinical sites throughout the United States. SUBJECTS: Forty-one adult patients (>/= 18 years old) with diffuse bronchiectasis affecting two or more lung segments and a history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. INTERVENTIONS: TSI, 300 mg tobramycin per dose bid. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During the 12-week treatment period, significant improvements (reduction of 1.5 U p = 0.006) occurred in mean pulmonary total symptom severity score, a composite score that assesses the severity of cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, fatigue, and wheezing. Significant improvements (reduction of 9.8 U p < 0.001) were also observed in St. George Respiratory Questionnaire scores, which measure health-related quality of life. Eradication or presumed eradication of P aeruginosa occurred in 6 of 27 evaluable subjects (22.2%).

Ten subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse events; in nine of these subjects, adverse events were considered probably or possibly related to treatment. The most common adverse events were cough, wheezing, and dyspnea.

  {"id":"Borzecki2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND Despite being the most common cardiac arrhythmia, little is known about racial differences in atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence and whether differences persist after accounting for known risk factors. METHODS We identified male respondents to the 1999 Large Health Survey of Veteran Enrollees who had an AF diagnosis in the VA administrative database during the preceding two years. RESULTS Of 664,754 male respondents, 5.3% had AF. By race, age-adjusted prevalence was 5.7% in whites, 3.4% in blacks, 3.0% in Hispanics, 5.4% in native Americans/Alaskans, 3.6% in Asians and 5.2% in Pacific Islanders (p<0.001). Of predisposing conditions, whites were more likely to have valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, blacks had the highest hypertension prevalence; Hispanics had the highest diabetes prevalence. Racial differences remained after adjustment for age, body mass index and these comorbidities. White males were significantly more likely to have AF compared to all races but Pacific Islanders [versus blacks, OR=1.84 (95% CI: 1.71-1.98); versus Hispanics, OR=1.77 (1.60-1.97); vs Native Americans, OR 1.15 [1.04-1.27]; versus Asians, OR=1.41 (1.12-1.77) versus Pacific Islanders, OR=1.16 (0.88-1.53)]. CONCLUSIONS AF prevalence varies by race. White males have the highest AF burden even after adjustment for known risk factors. Recognition of the high AF prevalence, especially among whites, as well as native Americans and Pacific Islanders, should help guide provider practices for screening among older male patients. Further research is necessary to verify and establish reasons for these racial differences.","author":[{"family":"Borzecki","given":"Ann M"},{"family":"Bridgers","given":"D Keith"},{"family":"Liebschutz","given":"Jane M"},{"family":"Kader","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Kazis","given":"Lewis E"},{"family":"Berlowitz","given":"Dan R"}],"citation-key":"Borzecki2008","container-title":"Journal of the National Medical Association","DOI":"10.1016/s0027-9684(15)31212-8","ISSN":"0027-9684","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",2]]},"page":"237-45","PMID":"18300541","title":"Racial differences in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation among males.","type":"article-journal","volume":"100"},

Studies have suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may result in cardiovascular disease. However, many past studies had important methodological limitations to their designs.\\n\\nMETHOD: Using Cox regressions, we assessed PTSD, age, race, intelligence, family history, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse, antisocial personality, and depression in predicting HD mortality at follow-up in December 31, 2000. The men were <65 years old at follow-up.\\n\\nRESULTS: Using two PTSD measures, a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition (DSM-III) measure (D-PTSD) and one developed by Keane (K-PTSD), we found that among Vietnam theater and era veterans combined (era veterans had no Vietnam service), having PTSD was associated with HD mortality for D-PTSD (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25, p = .045) and approached significance for K-PTSD (HR = 2.16, p = .066). However, having higher PTSD symptoms on either scale was associated with mortality, with a 5-point increase associated with approximately 20% increase in mortality risk (all p < .05). Controlling for lifetime depression only slightly altered the results. The effects for theater veterans alone were stronger (D-PTSD: HR = 2.58, p = .025; K-PTSD: HR = 2.73, p = .022). Among theater veterans, controlling for lifetime depression or combat exposure made little difference.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: PTSD was prospectively associated with HD mortality among veterans free of HD at baseline. This study suggests that early-age HD may be an outcome after military service among PTSD-positive veterans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Boscarino","given":"Joseph A"}],"citation-key":"Boscarino2008","container-title":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817bccaf","ISBN":"1534-7796 (Electronic)\\r0033-3174 (Linking)","ISSN":"00333174","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"page":"668-676","PMID":"18596248","title":"A prospective study of ptsd and early-age heart disease mortality among vietnam veterans: Implications for surveillance and prevention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006842-200807000-00007","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"Bosch2009","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine in a nonclinical sample of preadolescents the possibility that somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Depression is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Dysregulation of the ANS and the HPA axis have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Several studies suggest that only a subset of the depression symptoms account for associations with cardiovascular prognosis. METHODS: Self-reported somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were examined in relationship to heart rate variability (HRV), spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in 2049 preadolescents (mean age = 11.1 years; 50.7% = girls) from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). RESULTS: Physiological measurements were not associated with the overall measure of depressive symptoms. Somatic depressive symptoms were negatively related to HRV and BRS, and positively to the CAR; cognitive-affective depressive symptoms were positively related to HRV and BRS, and negatively to the CAR. Associations with the CAR pertained to boys only. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms differ in their association with both cardiac autonomic and HPA axis function in preadolescents. Particularly, somatic depression symptoms may mark cardiac risk.","author":[{"family":"Bosch","given":"Nienke M."},{"family":"Riese","given":"Harriëtte"},{"family":"Dietrich","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ormel","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Verhulst","given":"Frank C."},{"family":"Oldehinkel","given":"Albertine J."}],"citation-key":"Bosch2009","container-title":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bc756b","ISBN":"6060600980","ISSN":"00333174","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"944-950","PMID":"19834052","title":"Preadolescents' somatic and cognitive-affective depressive symptoms are differentially related to cardiac autonomic function and cortisol: The TRAILS study","type":"article-journal","volume":"71"},

A circadian variation in the regulation of the cardiovascular system could contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk in the morning. Indeed, circadian rhythms have been shown for a wide array of physiological processes. Using an ultradian sleep-wake cycle (USW) procedure, we sought to determine how heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) correlate with the well-characterized circadian rhythms of cortisol and melatonin secretion. Specific HRV components, namely the low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power, and the LF:HF ratio can be used as markers of the autonomic modulation of the heart. Cross-correlation between HRV parameters and hormonal rhythms demonstrated that mean RR interval is significantly phase-advanced relative to salivary cortisol and urinary 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin (UaMt6s). Parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF power) was phase-advanced relative to cortisol, but was in-phase with UaMt6s levels. Maximal correlation of the sympathovagal balance (the LF:HF ratio) had no significant lag compared to cortisol secretion and UaMt6s excretion. The protective effect of the parasympathetic nervous system at night, combined with the putative risk associated with the sympathetic nervous system peaking in the morning, could be associated with the increased cardiovascular risk observed in the morning hours.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Boudreau","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Dumont","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Kin","given":"N.

  {"id":"Brack2007","abstract":"We have previously shown that direct vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces the slope of action potential duration (APD) restitution while simultaneously protecting the heart against induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of any sympathetic activity or tone. In the current study we have examined the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the effect of VNS. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from a left ventricular epicardial site on innervated, isolated rabbit hearts (n = 7). Standard restitution, effective refractory period (ERP) and VF threshold (VFT) were measured at baseline and during VNS in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 200 microm) and during reversing NO blockade with L-arginine (L-Arg, 1 mm). Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M. The restitution curve was shifted upwards and became less steep with VNS when compared to baseline. L-NA blocked the effect of VNS whereas L-Arg restored the effect of VNS. The maximum slope of restitution was reduced from 1.17 +/- 0.14 to 0.60 +/- 0.09 (50 +/- 5%, P < 0.0001) during control, from 0.98 +/- 0.14 to 0.93 +/- 0.12 (2 +/- 10%, P = NS) in the presence of L-NA and from 1.16 +/- 0.17 to 0.50 +/- 0.10 (41 +/- 9%, P = 0.003) with L-Arg plus L-NA. ERP was increased by VNS in control from 119 +/- 6 ms to 130 +/- 6 ms (10 +/- 5%, P = 0.045) and this increase was not affected by L-NA (120 +/- 4 to 133 +/- 4 ms, 11 +/- 3%, P = 0.0019) or L-Arg with L-NA (114 +/- 4 to 123 +/- 4 ms, 8 +/- 2%, P = 0.006). VFT was increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 5.8 +/- 0.5 mA (98 +/- 12%, P = 0.0017) in control, 3.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 mA (13 +/- 12%, P = 0.6) during perfusion with L-NA and 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 mA (175 +/- 50%, P = 0.0017) during perfusion with L-Arg plus L-NA. Direct VNS increased VFT and flattened the slope of APD restitution curve in this isolated rabbit heart preparation with intact autonomic nerves. These effects were blocked using L-NA and reversed by replenishing the substrate for NO production with L-Arg. This is the first study to demonstrate that NO plays an important role in the anti-fibrillatory effect of VNS on the rabbit ventricle, possibly via effects on APD restitution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Brack","given":"Kieran E"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Vanlata H"},{"family":"Coote","given":"John H"},{"family":"Ng","given":"G André"}],"citation-key":"Brack2007","container-title":"Journal of Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/jphysiol.2007.138461","ISBN":"0022-3751 (Print)\\r0022-3751 (Linking)","ISSN":"00223751","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"page":"695-704","PMID":"17627986","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","title":"Nitric oxide mediates the vagal protective effect on ventricular fibrillation via effects on action potential duration restitution in the rabbit heart","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17627986","volume":"583"},

  {"id":"Bremner2018","abstract":"Objective Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and despite important advances in our understanding of this disorder, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. Recently, increased attention has been placed on the role of behavioral factors such as emotional stress on CAD risk. Brain areas involved in memory and the stress response, including medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and parietal cortex, also have outputs to the peripheral cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of mental stress on brain and cardiac function in patients with CAD. Methods CAD patients (N = 170) underwent cardiac imaging with [Tc-99m] sestamibi single-photon emission tomography at rest and during a public speaking mental stress task. On another day, they underwent imaging of the brain with [O-15] water positron emission tomography (PET) during mental stress (arithmetic and public speaking) and control conditions. Results Patients with mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia showed increased activation with stress in anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortex (p <.005). This was seen with both arithmetic stress and public speaking stress. Arithmetic stress was additionally associated with left insula activation, and public speaking with right pre/postcentral gyrus and middle temporal gyrus activation (p <.005). Conclusions These findings suggest that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with activation in brain areas involved in the stress response and autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. Altered brain reactivity to stress could possibly represent a mechanism through which stress leads to increased risk of CAD-related morbidity and mortality.","author":[{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Brennan2001","abstract":"Heart rate variability (HRV) is concerned with the analysis of the intervals between heartbeats. An emerging analysis technique is the Poincaré plot, which takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval. The geometry of this plot has been shown to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy subjects in clinical settings. The Poincaré plot is a valuable HRV analysis technique due to its ability to display nonlinear aspects of the interval sequence. The problem is, how do we quantitatively characterize the plot to capture useful summary descriptors that are independent of existing HRV measures? Researchers have investigated a number of techniques: converting the two-dimensional plot into various one-dimensional views; the fitting of an ellipse to the plot shape; and measuring the correlation coefficient of the plot. We investigate each of these methods in detail and show that they are all measuring linear aspects of the intervals which existing HRV indexes already specify. The fact that these methods appear insensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the intervals is an important finding because the Poincaré plot is primarily a nonlinear technique.

To validate the model, simulations of various nervous conditions are compared with heart rate variability (HRV) data obtained from subjects under each prescribed condition. For a variety of sympathovagal balances, our model generates Poincar{é} plots that undergo alterations strongly resembling those of actual R-R intervals. By exploiting the oscillator basis of our model, we detail the way that low- and high-frequency modulation of the sinus node translates into R-R interval Poincar{é} plot shape by way of simulations and analytic results. With the use of our model, we establish that the length and width of a Poincar{é} plot are a weighted combination of low- and high-frequency power. This provides a theoretical link between frequency-domain spectral analysis techniques and time-domain Poincar{é} plot analysis.

Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989.

  {"id":"Brooks2014","abstract":"Objective: This study examines how the social environment is related to allostatic load (AL), a multisystem index of biological risk. Method: A national sample of adults (N = 949) aged 34-84 rated their relationships with spouse, family, and friends at 2 time points 10 years apart. At the second time point, participants completed a biological protocol in which indices of autonomic, hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal axis, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic function were obtained and used to create an AL summary score. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations among 3 aspects of social relationships-social support, social negativity, and frequency of social contact-and AL. Results: Higher levels of spouse negativity, family negativity, friend contact, and network level contact were each associated with higher AL, and higher levels of spouse support were associated with lower AL, independent of age, sociodemographic factors, and health covariates. Tests for age interactions suggested that friend support and network support were each associated with higher AL among older adults, but at younger ages there appeared to be no association between friend support and AL and a negative association between network support and AL. For network negativity, there was a marginal interaction such that network negativity was associated with higher AL among younger adults but there was no association among older adults. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that structural and functional aspects of the social environment are associated with AL, and extend previous work by demonstrating that these associations vary based on the type of relationship assessed and by age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brooks","given":"Kathryn P."},{"family":"Gruenewald","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Karlamangla","given":"Arun"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Peifung"},{"family":"Koretz","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Seeman","given":"Teresa E."}],"citation-key":"Brooks2014","container-title":"Health Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0034528","ISSN":"19307810","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1373-1381","PMID":"24447186","publisher":"American Psychological Association Inc.","title":"Social relationships and allostatic load in the midus study","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC4104264/?report=abstract","volume":"33"},

The sinus cycle length (836 ± 156 to 648 ± 84 ms, mean ± standard deviation), measured Q-T interval (367 ± 26 to 329 ± 26 ms), and atrially paced Q-T interval (330 ± 28 to 315 ±27 ms) shortened after atropine plus propranolol (p <0.001), but the corrected Q-T interval with use of Bazett's formula did not change (402 ± 33 to 412 ± 24 ms). The ventricular effective refractory period also shortened from 241 to 20 to 218 ± 21 ms after atropine plus propranolol (p <0.02). The sinus cycle length increased after propranolol (750 ± 97 to 907 ± 108 ms, p <0.001), but no change occurred in the measured Q-T interval or atrial paced Q-T interval although the corrected Q-T interval using Bazett's formula was greatly shortened (428 ± 15 to 391 ±22 ms, p <0.001). The sinus cycle length, measured Q-T interval, and atrially paced Q-T interval decreased after atropine (p <0.01), but the corrected Q-T interval lengthened (375 ± 29 to 418 ± 28 ms, p <0.01). In summary, atropine and atropine plus propranolol shorten the Q-T interval independent of rate, demonstrating a direct vagal effect on the Q-T interval. Bazett's formula inaccurately predicts the Q-T interval after administration of atropine, propranolol, and atropine plus propranolol. © 1981.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Browne","given":"Kevin F"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"Douglas P"},{"family":"Heger","given":"James J"},{"family":"Prystowsky","given":"Eric N"}],"citation-key":"Browne1982","container-title":"The American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/0002-9149(82)90425-8","ISBN":"0002-9149","ISSN":"00029149","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",11,1]]},"page":"1099-1103","PMID":"7137037","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Influence of the autonomic nervous system on the Q-T interval in man","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7137037","volume":"50"},

One AFL circuit can have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions, or impaired atrial substrate. Conversely, different (right sided or even left sided) atrial circuits including different mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal) can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation. The development of efficient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms, as well as facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation.

Clinical spectrum of MC ranges from asymptomatic state to clinically-apparent vasculitis involving multiple organs. In the era of Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapy, patients with HCV-related MC achieve high rates of viral clearance that is commonly accompanied by an improvement in clinical symptoms as well as immunological profiles. Rituximab, either alone or in combination with DAA, has also been shown to be effective. Nevertheless, there have been limited and somewhat conflicting data, particularly over the long-term, regarding the rate and degree of clinical response of MC following DAA therapy. It appears that we have come quite a long way in the last decade with this condition. As with non-MC related HCV, undoubtedly long term outcome data will be forthcoming over the next few years. As we move forward successful therapy of HCV is not likely to be a challenge in contrast to access to therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunchorntavakul","given":"Chalermrat"},{"family":"Mitrani","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"K Rajender"}],"citation-key":"Bunchorntavakul2018","container-title":"Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jceh.2017.11.012","ISSN":"22133453","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"81-94","PMID":"29743799","title":"Advances in HCV and Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis in the Era of DAAs: Are We at the End of the Road?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jceh.2017.11.012","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"Bunting2021","abstract":"The validity and reproducibility of systolic function assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using cardiac magnetic resonance, echocardiography, nuclear imaging and computed tomography is unknown. A prospectively-registered systematic review was performed, including 24 published studies with patients in AF at the time of imaging and reporting validity or reproducibility data on left ventricular systolic parameters (PROSPERO: CRD42018091674). Data extraction and risk of bias were performed by 2 investigators independently and synthesized qualitatively. In 3 cardiac magnetic resonance studies (40 AF patients), left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume measurements correlated highly with catheter angiography (r ≥0.85), and intra- and/or interobserver variability were low. From 3 nuclear studies (171 AF patients), there were no external validation assessments but intra and/or interobserver and intersession variability were low. In 18 echocardiography studies (2,566 AF patients), 2 studies showed high external validity of global longitudinal strain and tissue Doppler s’ with angiography-derived dP/dt (r ≥0.88). Global longitudinal strain and myocardial performance index were both associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Reproducibility of echocardiography was better when selecting an index-beat (where 2 preceding R-to-R intervals are similar) compared to averaging of consecutive beats. There were no studies relating to computed tomography. Most studies were small and biased by selection of patients with good quality images, limiting clinical extrapolation of results. The validity of systolic function measurements in patients with AF remains unclear due to the paucity of good-quality data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bunting","given":"Karina V."},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Kieran"},{"family":"Steeds","given":"Richard P."},{"family":"Kotecha","given":"Dipak"}],"citation-key":"Bunting2021","container-title":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.10.012","ISSN":"18791913","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,15]]},"page":"40-49","PMID":"33065079","publisher":"Excerpta Medica","title":"Cardiac Imaging to Assess Left Ventricular Systolic Function in Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","volume":"139"},

  {"id":"Butler2020","abstract":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a change in the 24 h pattern of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Adverse cardiovascular events occur more frequently in the middle of the night in people with OSA, earlier than the morning prevalence of these events in the general population. It is unknown if these changes are associated with a change in the underlying circadian rhythms, independent of behaviors such as sleep, physical activity, and meal intake. In this exploratory analysis, we studied the endogenous circadian rhythms of blood pressure, heart rate, melatonin and cortisol in 11 participants (48 ± 4 years; seven with OSA) throughout a 5 day study that was originally designed to examine circadian characteristics of obstructive apnea events. After a baseline night, participants completed 10 recurring 5 h 20 min behavioral cycles divided evenly into standardized sleep and wake periods. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in a relaxed semirecumbent posture 15 minutes after each scheduled wake time. Salivary melatonin and cortisol concentrations were measured at 1–1.5 h intervals during wakefulness. Mixed-model cosinor analyses were performed to determine the rhythmicity of all variables with respect to external time and separately to circadian phases (aligned to the dim light melatonin onset, DLMO). The circadian rhythm of blood pressure peaked much later in OSA compared to control participants (group × circadian phase, p < .05); there was also a trend toward a slightly delayed cortisol rhythm in the OSA group. Rhythms of heart rate and melatonin did not differ between the groups. In this exploratory analysis, OSA appears to be associated with a phase change (relative to DLMO) in the endogenous circadian rhythm of blood pressure during relaxed wakefulness, independent of common daily behaviors.","author":[{"family":"Butler","given":"Matthew P."},{"family":"Thosar","given":"Saurabh S."},{"family":"Smales","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"DeYoung","given":"Pamela N."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Huijuan"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Mohammad V."},{"family":"Morimoto","given":"Miki"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Scheer","given":"Frank A.J.L."},{"family":"Shea","given":"Steven A."}],"citation-key":"Butler2020","container-title":"Chronobiology International","DOI":"10.1080/07420528.2020.1740723","ISSN":"15256073","issue":"00","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-11","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","title":"Effects of obstructive sleep apnea on endogenous circadian rhythms assessed during relaxed wakefulness; an exploratory analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1740723","volume":"00"},
  {"id":"Bylund2017","abstract":"Heart development depends on coordinated proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but how the two processes are synchronized is not well understood. Here, we show that the secreted Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist GREMLIN 2 (GREM2) is induced in CPCs shortly after cardiac mesoderm specification during differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. GREM2 expression follows cardiac lineage differentiation independently of the differentiation method used, or the origin of the pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that GREM2 is linked to cardiogenesis. Addition of GREM2 protein strongly increases cardiomyocyte output compared to established procardiogenic differentiation methods. Our data show that inhibition of canonical BMP signaling by GREM2 is necessary to promote proliferation of CPCs. However, canonical BMP signaling inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation, which depends on subsequent JNK pathway activation specifically by GREM2. These findings may have broader implications in the design of approaches to orchestrate growth and differentiation of pluripotent stem cell-derived lineages that depend on precise regulation of BMP signaling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bylund","given":"Jeffery B."},{"family":"Trinh","given":"Linh T."},{"family":"Awgulewitsch","given":"Cassandra P."},{"family":"Paik","given":"David T."},{"family":"Jetter","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Jha","given":"Rajneesh"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Nolan","given":"Kristof"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chunhui"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Thomas B."},{"family":"Kamp","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Hatzopoulos","given":"Antonis K."}],"citation-key":"Bylund2017","container-title":"Stem Cells and Development","DOI":"10.1089/scd.2016.0226","ISBN":"1557-8534 (Electronic)\\r1547-3287 (Linking)","ISSN":"1547-3287","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,1]]},"page":"678-693","PMID":"28125926","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA","title":"Coordinated Proliferation and Differentiation of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Progenitor Cells Depend on Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Regulation by GREMLIN 2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2016.0226","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"Callans2004","abstract":"purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between psychiatric depression and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The hypothesis was that depressed patients with CAD would have a higher prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) than nondepressed patients with CAD. patients and methods: One hundred three patients who were found to have significant CAD by elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization were administered a standardized psychiatric interview and underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. results: Twenty-one patients (20%) met the criteria for either major or minor depression. There were no significant differences between depressed and nondepressed patients with CAD in severity of CAD or in ventricular function. Five (23.8%) of the depressed patients and three (3.7%) of the nondepressed patients exhibited episodes of VT during 24 hours of Holter monitoring (p <0.008). This difference remained significant even after controlling for relevant covariates. conclusions: We conclude that there is a higher prevalence of VT among patients with CAD and depression than among those CAD patients without depression.

  {"id":"Cannon1931","abstract":"The close dependence of vascular tone on sympathetic impulses as shown by more or less persistent vasodilatation when the sympathetic nerves to arterioles are cut, the importance of vascular tone for the proper distribution of blood in the body, and the recent increase in the application of surgery to the sympathetic system render important an enquiry into the effect of sympathectomy on blood pressure. The work of W. B. Cannon, Lewis and Britton (1927) proved that animals can survive total abolition of sympathetic activity in the body. It was clear, therefore, that a study could be made of the effects on blood pressure of extirpating not only parts of the sympathetic system but the whole system as a distributor of tonic impulses to blood vessels. METHOD. For the present study dogs between 11 kgm. and 13 kgm. in weight were used. They were found large enough to allow accurate readings of the blood pressure and small enough to make operating possible. They were trained to lie quietly on a table during the blood-pressure de-terminations. A typical rubber cuff, reduced in width to about 8 cm., was used, and the pressure was measured by means of a mercury manometer. The cuff was applied to the leg below the knee; a small diaphragm stethoscope , or palpation, or both, were used to determine the disappearance and reappearance of the pulse. The artery (dorsalis pedis) on the anterior surface of the foot served for the observations. By this method it was possible to get reasonably consistent results in repeated observations within a brief period under similar conditions. Care was taken to place the cuff as nearly as possible in the same position in successive readings. The heart rate was recorded with the blood pressure. With one exception the parts of the sympathetic system were removed in the same order. The first step was the removal of both abdominal chains from the diaphragm to the sacrum and the severance of the right splanch-nits at the diaphragm. The second was the removal of the right thoracic chain from the stellate ganglion to the diaphragm through which were pulled the remnants of the splanchnics. The final operation involved the removal of the left thoracic chain from the stellate ganglion to the dia-592","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cannon","given":"Bradford"}],"citation-key":"Cannon1931","container-title":"American Journal of Physiology-Legacy Content","DOI":"10.1152/ajplegacy.1931.97.4.592","ISSN":"0002-9513","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1931",7,1]]},"page":"592-596","title":"THE EFFECTS OF PROGRESSIVE SYMPATHECTOMY ON BLOOD PRESSURE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajplegacy.1931.97.4.592","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"Capucci1995","abstract":"Background The aims of our study were to investigate the meaning of local atrial activation and its behavior during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and to study the effect of overdrive pacing on local atrial activity.\n\nMethods and Results Twenty-five patients with lone paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent electrophysiological study. Functional and effective atrial refractoriness was determined. Mean and fifth percentile values of 100 consecutive atrial fibrillation intervals (FF) were evaluated at three atrial sites either at arrhythmia onset or at self-termination (or at minute 5). A high-voltage burst pacing was performed after 6 minutes of stable atrial fibrillation in 10 patients. Mean FF intervals were evaluated 5 seconds before and after atrial pacing. Forty-nine atrial fibrillation episodes were induced: 39 self-terminating within 5 minutes and 10 long-lasting. A significant correlation was found between mean FF and atrial functional refractory period (r=.73, P<.001) and between fifth percentile FF and atrial effective refractory period (r=.57, P<.005). Atrial fibrillation self-termination was associated with significant mean FF prolongation, whereas long-lasting fibrillation behaved the opposite. In 10 patients, burst pacing resulted in significant shortening of the mean FF at the stimulation site; no changes were observed in the two distant recording sites.\n\nConclusions The analysis of the FF intervals demonstrates a strict correlation with atrial functional refractoriness. The self-termination of atrial fibrillation is related to a prolongation of the functional refractoriness (mean FF), whereas a shortening of both functional and effective refractoriness (fifth percentile) is associated with atrial fibrillation persistence. The provoked shortening of the mean FF at the stimulation site is consistent with the presence of a gap of excitability during atrial fibrillation in the human atria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Capucci","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Biffi","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Boriani","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Ravelli","given":"Flavia"},{"family":"Nollo","given":"Giandomenico"},{"family":"Sabbatani","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Orsi","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Magnani","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"Capucci1995","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.92.5.1193","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",9]]},"page":"1193-1202","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Dynamic Electrophysiological Behavior of Human Atria During Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.92.5.1193","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"Carden2017","abstract":"Abnormal sickle red blood cell (sRBC) biomechanics, including pathological deformability and adhesion, correlate with clinical severity in sickle cell disease (SCD). Clinical intravenous fluids (IVFs) of various tonicities are often used during treatment of vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE), the major cause of morbidity in SCD. However, evidence-based guidelines are lacking, and there is no consensus regarding which IVFs to use during VOE. Further, it is unknown how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with IVFs affects sRBC biomechanics in the microcirculation, where vaso-occlusion takes place. Here, we report how altering extracellular fluid tonicity with admixtures of clinical IVFs affects sRBC biomechanical properties by leveraging novel in vitro microfluidic models of the microcirculation, including 1 capable of deoxygenating the sRBC environment to monitor changes in microchannel occlusion risk and an \"endothelialized\" microvascular model that measures alterations in sRBC/endothelium adhesion under postcapillary venular conditions. Admixtures with higher tonicities (sodium = 141 mEq/L) affected sRBC biomechanics by decreasing sRBC deformability, increasing sRBC occlusion under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and increasing sRBC adhesion in our microfluidic human microvasculature models. Admixtures with excessive hypotonicity (sodium = 103 mEq/L), in contrast, decreased sRBC adhesion, but overswelling prolonged sRBC transit times in capillary-sized microchannels. Admixtures with intermediate tonicities (sodium = 111-122 mEq/L) resulted in optimal changes in sRBC biomechanics, thereby reducing the risk for vaso-occlusion in our models. These results have significant translational implications for patients with SCD and warrant a large-scale prospective clinical study addressing optimal IVF management during VOE in SCD.","author":[{"family":"Carden","given":"Marcus A."},{"family":"Fay","given":"Meredith E."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xinran"},{"family":"Mannino","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Sakurai","given":"Yumiko"},{"family":"Ciciliano","given":"Jordan C."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Caroline E."},{"family":"Chonat","given":"Satheesh"},{"family":"Joiner","given":"Clinton H."},{"family":"Wood","given":"David K."},{"family":"Lam","given":"Wilbur A."}],"citation-key":"Carden2017","container-title":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2017-04-780635","ISSN":"15280020","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"2654-2663","PMID":"28978568","title":"Extracellular fluid tonicity impacts sickle red blood cell deformability and adhesion","type":"article-journal","volume":"130"},

We hypothesized that nicotinic stimulation of individual GPs exerts divergent regional influences, affecting atrial as well as ventricular functions. In 22 anesthetized canines, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 atrial and 127 ventricular epicardial loci during nicotine injection (100 mcg in 0.1 ml) into either the 1) right atrial (RA), 2) dorsal atrial, 3) left atrial, 4) inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial, 5) right ventricular, 6) ventral septal ventricular or 7) cranial medial ventricular (CMV) GP. In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95% of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75% among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs. RAGP predominantly affected the RA and posterior right ventricular walls whereas CMVGP elicited biatrial and biventricular repolarization changes.

  {"id":"Carlin2005","abstract":"Twin studies have long been recognized for their value in learning about the aetiology of disease and specifically for their potential for separating genetic effects from environmental effects. The recent upsurge of interest in life-course epidemiology and the study of developmental influences on later health has provided a new impetus to study twins as a source of unique insights. Twins are of special interest because they provide naturally matched pairs where the confounding effects of a large number of potentially causal factors (such as maternal nutrition or gestation length) may be removed by comparisons between twins who share them. The traditional tool of epidemiological ‘risk factor analysis’ is the regression model, but it is not straightforward to transfer standard regression methods to twin data, because the analysis needs to reflect the paired structure of the data, which induces correlation between twins. This paper reviews the use of more specialized regression methods for twin data, based on generalized least squares or linear mixed models, and explains the relationship between these methods and the commonly used approach of analysing within-twin-pair difference values. Methods and issues of interpretation are illustrated using an example from a recent study of the association between birth weight and cord blood erythropoietin. We focus on the analysis of continuous outcome measures but review additional complexities that arise with binary outcomes. We recommend the use of a general model that includes separate regression coefficients for within-twin-pair and between-pair effects, and provide guidelines for the interpretation of estimates obtained under this model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlin","given":"John B"},{"family":"Gurrin","given":"Lyle C"},{"family":"Sterne","given":"Jonathan AC C"},{"family":"Morley","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Dwyer","given":"Terry"}],"citation-key":"Carlin2005","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyi153","ISBN":"0300-5771 (Print)\\r0300-5771","ISSN":"03005771","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10,1]]},"page":"1089-1099","PMID":"16087687","publisher":"Oxford University Press on","title":"Regression models for twin studies: A critical review","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/ije/article/34/5/1089/645923/Regression-models-for-twin-studies-a-critical","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"Carnevali2018","abstract":"Stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology. Humans exposed to aversive or stressful experiences show considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in their responses. However, the majority does not develop stress-related psychiatric disorders. The dynamic processes encompassing positive and functional adaptation in the face of significant adversity have been broadly defined as resilience. Traditionally, the assessment of resilience has been confined to self-report measures, both within the general community and putative high-risk populations. Although this approach has value, it is highly susceptible to subjective bias and may not capture the dynamic nature of resilience, as underlying construct. Recognizing the obvious benefits of more objective measures of resilience, research in the field has just started investigating the predictive value of several potential biological markers. This review provides an overview of theoretical views and empirical evidence suggesting that individual differences in heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of resting cardiac vagal outflow, may underlie different levels of resilience toward the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Following this line of thought, recent studies describing associations between regional brain morphometric characteristics and resting state vagally-mediated HRV are summarized. Existing studies suggest that the structural morphology of the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), particularly its cortical thickness, is implicated in the expression of individual differences in HRV. These findings are discussed in light of emerging structural neuroimaging research, linking morphological characteristics of the ACC to psychological traits ascribed to a high-resilient profile and abnormal structural integrity of the ACC to the psychophysiological expression of stress-related mental health consequences. We conclude that a multidisciplinary approach integrating brain structural imaging with HRV monitoring could offer novel perspectives about brain-body pathways in resilience and adaptation to psychological stress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Carnevali","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Sgoifo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Ottaviani","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"Carnevali2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","DOI":"10.3389/fnins.2018.00228","ISSN":"1662453X","issue":"APR","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,6]]},"page":"228","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"Autonomic and brain morphological predictors of stress resilience","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC5897537/?report=abstract","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"Carney2000","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Major depression is a common problem in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality. It is not known whether treating depression will improve medical prognosis in patients with CHD. Depression is also associated with elevated heart rate and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), which are known risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality that may explain the increased risk associated with depression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment for depression with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is associated with decreased heart rate or increased HRV. METHODS Thirty depressed patients with stable CHD, classified as either mildly or moderately to severely depressed, received up to 16 sessions of CBT. The 24-hour heart rate and HRV were measured in these patients and in 22 medically comparable nondepressed controls before and after treatment of the depressed patients. RESULTS Average heart rate and daytime rMSSD (reflecting mostly parasympathetic activity) improved significantly in the severely depressed patients, but remained unchanged in the mildly depressed and the control patients. However, only rMSSD improved to a level comparable to the control patients. None of the remaining indices of HRV showed improvement. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that treating depression with CBT may reduce heart rate and increase short-term HRV. Thus, CBT may have a beneficial effect on a risk factor for mortality in depressed patients with coronary heart disease. A randomized, controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.","author":[{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Phyllis K."},{"family":"Skala","given":"Judith A."},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Allan S."}],"citation-key":"Carney2000","DOI":"10.1097/00006842-200009000-00007","ISBN":"0033-3174","ISSN":"00333174","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"639-647","PMID":"11020093","title":"Change in heart rate and heart rate variability during treatment for depression in patients with coronary heart disease","type":"report","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11020093","volume":"62"},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether low heart rate variability (HRV) mediates the effect of depression on mortality.Twenty-four–hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were obtained from 311 depressed patients with a recent acute MI who were enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial and from 367 nondepressed patients who met the ENRICHD medical inclusion criteria. Standard HRV indexes were extracted from the recordings.The log of very low-frequency (LnVLF) power, an index of HRV derived from power spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram signal (0.0033-0.04 Hz [in milliseconds squared]), was lower in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients (P&lt;.001). There were 47 deaths (6.1%) during a 30-month follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, the depressed patients remained at higher risk for all-cause mortality compared with the nondepressed patients (hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.4; P&lt;.003). When LnVLF power was entered into the model, the hazard ratio for depression dropped to 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.2; P = .03). The proportion of the risk for depression attributable to LnVLF power was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31; P&lt;.001).Low HRV partially mediates the effect of depression on survival after acute MI. This finding helps to clarify the physiological mechanisms underlying depression’s role as a risk factor for mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. It also raises the possibility that treatments that improve both depression and HRV might also improve survival in these patients.Arch Intern Med. 2005;165:1486-1491-->","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Blumenthal","given":"James A."},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Phyllis K."},{"family":"Howells","given":"William B."},{"family":"Berkman","given":"Lisa F."},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Lana L."},{"family":"Czajkowski","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Hayano","given":"Junichiro"},{"family":"Domitrovich","given":"Peter P."},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Allan S."}],"citation-key":"Carney2005a","container-title":"Archives of Internal Medicine","container-title-short":"Archives of Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486","ISSN":"0003-9926","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",7,11]]},"page":"1486-1491","source":"Silverchair","title":"Low Heart Rate Variability and the Effect of Depression on Post–Myocardial Infarction Mortality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.13.1486","volume":"165"},
  {"id":"Carney2007","abstract":"Background: Depression is associated with an increased risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, proinflammatory processes, and procoagulant processes have been suggested as possible explanations. Methods: Heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of cardiac autonomic regulation, and markers of inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] and coagulation (fibrinogen) were assessed in 44 depressed patients with CHD. Results: Moderate, negative correlations were found between fibrinogen and four measures of HRV. IL-6 also negatively correlated with one measure of HRV (total power) and was marginally related to two others (very low frequency and low frequency power). Neither CRP nor TNF-α was significantly related to any measure of HRV. Conclusions: The finding that fibrinogen and IL-6 are moderately related to HRV suggests a link between these factors in depressed CHD patients. The relationship between ANS function and inflammatory and coagulant processes should be investigated in larger mechanistic studies of depression and cardiac morbidity and mortality. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"Carney2007a","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Depression is a risk factor for mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), possibly as a result of altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation of heart rate (HR) and rhythm. The purposes of this study were to determine: a) whether depressed patients are more likely to have an abnormal HR response (i.e., abnormal turbulence) to premature ventricular contractions (VPCs), and b) whether abnormal HR turbulence accounts for the effect of depression on increased mortality after AMI. METHODS Ambulatory electrocardiographic data were obtained from 666 (316 depressed, 350 nondepressed) patients with a recent AMI; 498 had VPCs with measurable HR turbulence. Of these, 260 had normal, 152 had equivocal, and 86 had abnormal HR turbulence. Patients were followed for up to 30 (median = 24) months. RESULTS Depressed patients were more likely to have abnormal HR turbulence (risk factor adjusted odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-3.0; p = .03) and have worse survival (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2-4.6; p = .02) than nondepressed patients. When HR turbulence was added to the model, the adjusted hazard ratio for depression decreased to 1.9 (95% CI = 0.9-3.8; p = .08), and to 1.6 (95% CI = 0.8-3.4; p = .18) when a measure of HR variability (LnVLF) was added. The hazard was found to differ over time with depression posing little risk for mortality in year 1 but greater risk in years 2 and 3 of the follow up. CONCLUSION ANS dysregulation may partially mediate the increased risk for mortality in depressed patients with frequent VPCs after an AMI.","author":[{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Howells","given":"William B."},{"family":"Blumenthal","given":"James A."},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Stein","given":"Phyllis K."},{"family":"Berkman","given":"Lisa F."},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Lana L."},{"family":"Czajkowski","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Steinmeyer","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Hayano","given":"Junichiro"},{"family":"Domitrovich","given":"Peter P."},{"family":"Burg","given":"Matthew M."},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Allan S."}],"citation-key":"Carney2007a","container-title":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.psy.0000249733.33811.00","ISBN":"0033-3174","ISSN":"00333174","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"4-9","PMID":"17167127","title":"Heart rate turbulence, depression, and survival after acute myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"Carraccio2008","abstract":"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Outcome Project has shifted the focus of residents' education to competency-based outcomes of learning. The challenge of meaningful assessment of learner competence has stimulated interest in the Dreyfus and Dreyfus Model, a framework for assessing skill acquisition that describes developmental stages beginning with novice and progressing through advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert, and master. Many educators have adopted this model, but no consensus about its adaptation to clinical medicine has been documented. In this article, the authors seek to integrate generally accepted knowledge and beliefs about how one learns to practice clinical medicine into a coherent developmental framework using the Dreyfus and Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. Using the general domain of patient care, the characteristics and skills of learners at each stage of development are translated into typical behaviors. A tangible picture of this model in real-world practice is provided through snapshots of typical learner performance at discrete moments in time along the developmental continuum. The Dreyfus and Dreyfus model is discussed in the context of other developmental models of assessment of learner competence. The limitations of the model, in particular the controversy around the behaviors of \"experts,\" are discussed in light of other interpretations of expertise in the literature. Support for descriptive developmental models of assessment is presented in the context of a discussion of the deconstructing versus reconstructing of competencies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Carraccio","given":"Carol L."},{"family":"Benson","given":"Bradley J."},{"family":"Nixon","given":"L James"},{"family":"Derstine","given":"Pamela L."}],"citation-key":"Carraccio2008","container-title":"Academic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/ACM.0b013e31817eb632","ISBN":"1938-808X (Electronic)\\r1040-2446 (Linking)","ISSN":"10402446","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"page":"761-767","PMID":"18667892","title":"From the educational bench to the clinical bedside: Translating the Dreyfus developmental model to the learning of clinical skills","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00001888-200808000-00017","volume":"83"},
  {"id":"Carreno2017b","abstract":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent. Although standards antidepressants are more effective than placebo, up to 35% of patients do not respond to 4 or more conventional treatments and are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Considerable effort has been devoted to trying to find effective treatments for TRD. This review focuses on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), approved for TRD in 2005 by the Food and Drugs Administration. Stimulation is carried by bipolar electrodes on the left cervical vagus nerve, which are attached to an implanted stimulator generator. The vagus bundle contains about 80% of afferent fibers terminating in the medulla, from which there are projections to many areas of brain, including the limbic forebrain. Various types of brain imaging studies reveal widespread functional effects in brain after either acute or chronic VNS. Although more randomized control trials of VNS need to be carried out before a definitive conclusion can be reached about its efficacy, the results of open studies, carried out over period of 1 to 2 years, show much more efficacy when compared with results from treatment as usual studies. There is an increase in clinical response to VNS between 3 and 12 months, which is quite different from that seen with standard antidepressant treatment of MDD. Preclinically, VNS affects many of the same brain areas, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine) and signal transduction mechanisms (brain-derived neurotrophic factor–tropomyosin receptor kinase B) as those found with traditional antidepressants. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which VNS benefits patients nonresponsive to conventional antidepressants is unclear, with further research needed to clarify this.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Carreno","given":"Flavia R."},{"family":"Frazer","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"Carreno2017b","container-title":"Neurotherapeutics","DOI":"10.1007/s13311-017-0537-8","ISSN":"18787479","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"page":"716-727","publisher":"Springer New York LLC","title":"Vagal Nerve Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"Carson2012","abstract":"Description: Although approximately 85 million units of red blood cells (RBCs) are transfused annually worldwide, transfusion practices vary widely. The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline to provide clinical recom- mendations about hemoglobin concentration thresholds and other clinical variables that trigger RBC transfusions in hemodynamically stable adults and children. Methods: These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials evaluating transfusion thresholds. We per- formed a literature search from 1950 to February 2011 with no language restrictions. We examined the proportion of patients who received any RBC transfusion and the number of RBC units trans- fused to describe the effect of restrictive transfusion strategies on RBC use. To determine the clinical consequences of restrictive trans- fusion strategies, we examined overall mortality, nonfatal myocar- dial infarction, cardiac events, pulmonary edema, stroke, thrombo- embolism, renal failure, infection, hemorrhage, mental confusion, functional recovery, and length of hospital stay. Recommendation 1: The AABB recommends adhering to a restric- tive transfusion strategy (7 to 8 g/dL) in hospitalized, stable pa- tients (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: The AABB suggests adhering to a restrictive strategy in hospitalized patients with preexisting cardiovascular dis- ease and considering transfusion for patients with symptoms or a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: The AABB cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospi- talized, hemodynamically stable patients with the acute cor- onary syndrome (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very low-quality evidence).

This is followed by mental stress as a scientific idea and the relatively new notions of allostasis and allostatic load. Experimental models of mental stress in rodents and humans are discussed, with particular attention to ethical constraints in humans.

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review. Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal. Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.","author":[{"family":"Castaldo","given":"R."},{"family":"Melillo","given":"P."},{"family":"Bracale","given":"U."},{"family":"Caserta","given":"M."},{"family":"Triassi","given":"M."},{"family":"Pecchia","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"Castaldo2015","container-title":"Biomedical Signal Processing and Control","DOI":"10.1016/j.bspc.2015.02.012","ISSN":"17468108","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"370-377","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Acute mental stress assessment via short term HRV analysis in healthy adults: A systematic review with meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2015.02.012","volume":"18"},

Specifically, recent data seem to support the hypothesis that low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), an index of sympathetic cardiac control, correlates with worse executive performances, worse ER, and specific psychopathological dimensions. The present work aims to review the previous findings on these topics and integrate them from two main cornerstones of this perspective: Porges' Polyvagal Theory and Thayer and Lane's Neurovisceral Integration Model, which are necessary to understand these associations better. For this reason, based on these two approaches, we point out that low HRV is associated with emotional dysregulation, worse cognitive performance, and transversal psychopathological conditions. We report studies that underline the importance of considering the heart-brain relation in order to shed light on the necessity to implement psychophysiology into a broader perspective on emotions, mental health, and good cognitive functioning. This integration is beneficial not only as a theoretical ground from which to start for further research studies but as a starting point for new theoretical perspectives useful in clinical practice.","author":[{"family":"Cattaneo","given":"Lorena Angela"},{"family":"Franquillo","given":"Anna Chiara"},{"family":"Grecucci","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Beccia","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Caretti","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Dadomo","given":"Harold"}],"citation-key":"Cattaneo2021","container-title":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","container-title-short":"J Pers Med","DOI":"10.3390/jpm11090872","ISSN":"2075-4426","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,31]]},"language":"eng","page":"872","PMCID":"PMC8465800","PMID":"34575648","source":"PubMed","title":"Is Low Heart Rate Variability Associated with Emotional Dysregulation, Psychopathological Dimensions, and Prefrontal Dysfunctions?

  {"id":"cen2012","abstract":"Aims Prospective studies have shown that social isolation (i.e. lack of social contacts) predicts incident coronary heart disease (CHD), but it is unclear whether it predicts incident heart failure (HF) and what factors might mediate this association. HF patients may be more susceptible to social isolation as they tend to be older and may have disrupted social relationships due to life course factors (e.g. retirement or bereavement). We prospectively examined whether individuals with higher vs. low social isolation have a higher incidence of HF and determined whether this association is mediated by vital exhaustion. Methods and Results We estimated incident HF hospitalization or death among 14 348 participants from Visit 2 (19901992) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study using Cox proportional hazard models which were sequentially adjusted for age, race/study community, gender, current smoking, alcohol use, and co-morbidities. We conducted mediation analyses according to the Baron and Kenny method. After a median follow-up of 16.9 person-years, 1727 (13.0) incident HF events occurred. The adjusted hazard of incident HF was greater for those in the higher vs. low social isolation risk group (hazard ratio 1.21, 95 confidence interval 1.081.35). Our data suggest that vital exhaustion strongly mediates the association between higher social isolation and incident HF (the percentage change in beta coefficient for higher vs. low social isolation groups after adjusting for vital exhaustion was 36).

We used progressive low dose atropine to induce changes in cardiac vagal tone to test the hypotheses that nonlinear HRV indices accurately reflect cardiac vagal control, and that their changes in response to low dose atropine correlate with those in RR interval. Methods: Changes in RR interval and HRV indices during intravenous injections of saline (control) and 6 cumulative doses of atropine (from 1.4 to 7.2 μg/kg) during controlled breathing at 15 breaths per minute were assessed in 14 young healthy individuals. Results: As expected, low dose atropine increased average RR interval (vagotonic effect). There was no strong association between vagotonic changes in RR interval and the majority of nonlinear HRV indices, either within or among subjects. Conclusions: These data suggest an inconsistent relationship between responses of nonlinear HRV indices and RR interval to changes in cardiac vagal tone. Therefore, nonlinear HRV indices may not be reliable indices of cardiac vagal control in healthy humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Cepeda","given":"Felipe X"},{"family":"Lapointe","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Can Ozan"},{"family":"Andrew Taylor","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Cepeda2018","container-title":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2018.04.007","ISSN":"18727484","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"1-7","PMID":"30005735","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Inconsistent relation of nonlinear heart rate variability indices to increasing vagal tone in healthy humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005735","volume":"213"},

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in candidate genes in ethnic minority probands with early-onset AF and determine genotype-phenotype associations. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort, family-based study, probands of African and Hispanic descent with early-onset AF (defined as AF occurring in individuals aged ≤66 years) prospectively enrolled in a clinical and genetic biorepository underwent sequencing of 60 candidate genes. Recruitment took place from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 1 to February 28, 2020. Exposures: Rare and novel variants categorized as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of rare and novel pathogenic variants in African American and Hispanic/Latinx probands with early-onset AF and genotype-phenotype associations. Results: Among 227 probands with early-onset AF, mean (SD) age at onset of AF was 51.0 (9.9) years, 132 probands (58.1%) were men, 148 (65.2%) were African American, and 79 (34.8%) were Hispanic/Latinx. A family history of AF was verified in 24 probands with early-onset AF (10.6%). Sequencing 60 candidate genes identified 53 (23 rare and 30 novel) variants with 16 of the 227 (7.0%) probands harboring likely pathogenic (43.8%) or pathogenic (56.2%) variants, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin (46.7%). In 6 families with more than 2 affected members, variants of unknown significance in sodium channel (SCN10A), potassium channel (KCNE5), sarcomeric proteins (MYH6 and TTN), and atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) cosegregated with AF. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were identified, with most loss-of-function variants in TTN, that increase susceptibility to early-onset AF in African American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals. These findings provide further understanding toward molecular phenotyping of AF and suggest novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for this common arrhythmia in ethnic minority groups..","author":[{"family":"Chalazan","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Mol","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Darbar","given":"Faisal A."},{"family":"Ornelas-Loredo","given":"Aylin"},{"family":"Al-Azzam","given":"Bahaa"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yining"},{"family":"Tofovic","given":"David"},{"family":"Sridhar","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Alzahrani","given":"Zain"},{"family":"Ellinor","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Darbar","given":"Dawood"}],"citation-key":"Chalazan2021","container-title":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2021.0994","ISSN":"23806591","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"page":"811-819","PMID":"33950154","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Association of Rare Genetic Variants and Early-Onset Atrial Fibrillation in Ethnic Minority Individuals","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Chan","abstract":"Cortisol has one of the most distinct and fascinating circadian rhythms in human physiology. This is regulated by the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. It has been suggested that cortisol acts as a secondary messenger between central and peripheral clocks, hence its importance in the synchronization of body circadian rhythms. Conventional immediate-release hydrocortisone, either at twice- or thrice-daily doses, is not capable of replicating physiological cortisol circadian rhythm and patients with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia still suffer from a poor quality of life and increased mortality. Novel treatments for replacement therapy are therefore essential. Proof-of-concept studies using hydrocortisone infusions suggest that the circadian delivery of hydrocortisone may improve biochemical control and life quality in patients lacking cortisol with an impaired cortisol rhythm. Recently oral formulations of modified-release hydrocortisone are being developed and it has been shown that it is possible to replicate cortisol circadian rhythm and also achieve better control of morning androgen levels. These new drug therapies are promising and potentially offer a more effective treatment with less adverse effects. Definite improvements clearly need to be established in future clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chan","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Debono","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"Chan","container-title":"Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism","DOI":"10.1177/2042018810380214","ISSN":"2042-0188","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"page":"129-38","PMID":"23148157","title":"Replication of cortisol circadian rhythm: new advances in hydrocortisone replacement therapy.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148157","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Chapman2016","abstract":"Aim Metformin is the most widely used oral hypoglycaemic drug, but it may lower B12status, which could have important clinical implications. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between metformin use and vitamin B12deficiency in persons with type 2 diabetes. Methods Electronic database searches were undertaken (1st January 1957–1st July 2013) using the Cochrane library, Scopus, CINAHL, Grey literature databases, Pub Med Central, NICE Clinical Guidelines UK, and ongoing clinical trials. Included studies were of any study design, with data from patients with type 2 diabetes of any age or gender, taking any dose or duration of metformin. Planned primary outcomes were serum vitamin B12levels, % prevalence or incidence of vitamin B12deficiency and risk of vitamin B12deficiency. Results Twenty-six papers were included in the review. Ten out of 17 observational studies showed statistically significantly lower levels of vitamin B12in patients on metformin than not on metformin. Meta-analysis performed on four trials demonstrated a statistically significant overall mean B12reducing effect of metformin of 57 pmol/L [WMD (fixed) = –0.57 (95% CI: –35 to –79 pmol/L)] after 6 weeks to 3 months of use. Conclusion The evidence from this review demonstrates an association between metformin usage and lower levels of vitamin B12by 57 pmol/L, which leads to frank deficiency or borderline status in some patients with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that it is prudent to monitor B12levels in these patients who are at increased risk of deficiency.","author":[{"family":"Chapman","given":"L. E."},{"family":"Darling","given":"A.

The Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect describe exquisite intrinsic mechanisms the heart has for autoregulating the force of contraction to maintain cardiac output under changes of preload and afterload. Although these mechanisms have been known for more than a century, their cellular and molecular underpinnings are still debated. How does the cardiac myocyte sense changes in preload or afterload? How does the myocyte adjust its response to compensate for such changes? In cardiac myocytes Ca 2+ is a crucial regulator of contractile force and in this review we compare and contrast recent studies from different labs that address these two important questions. The 'dimensionality' of the mechanical milieu under which experiments are carried out provide important clues to the location of the mechanosensors and the kinds of mechanical forces they can sense and respond to. As a first approximation, sensors inside the myocyte appear to modulate reactive oxygen species while sensors on the cell surface appear to also modulate nitric oxide signalling; both signalling pathways affect Ca 2+ handling. Undoubtedly, further studies will add layers to this simplified picture. Clarifying the intimate links from cellular mechanics to reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling and to Ca 2+ handling will deepen our understanding of the Frank–Starling law and the Anrep effect, and also provide a unified view on how arrhythmias may arise in seemingly disparate diseases that have in common altered myocyte mechanics.

Izu collaborate in an interdisciplinary team to combine experiments with mathematical modeling for in-depth analyses of the interaction of three dynamics systems – electrical, Ca 2+ signaling, and mechanical systems – that govern cardiac function and heart diseases. Abstract figure legend Surface and internal mechanosensors link to NO and ROS signalling and to Ca 2+ handling. Surface (blue) and internal (red and green) mechanosensors are depicted as springs. In experimental systems where the myocyte is in bathing solution that offers little mechanical resistance, the surface mechanosensors experience little or no strain (change in length divided by original length) as shown in the left panel. The internal mechanosensors experience strain and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect Ca 2+ handling. In other experimental systems the myocyte is adherent to a stretchable membrane or encased in a viscoelastic gel that provides mechanical resistance as the cell contracts or stretches; this mechanical loading causes surface mechanosensor strain as shown in the right panel. In these systems both internal and surface mechanosensors are activated.

  {"id":"Chen2001","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to review the nerve sprouting hypothesis of sudden cardiac death. It is known that sympathetic stimulation is important in the generation of sudden cardiac death. For example, there is a diurnal variation of sudden death rate in patients with myocardial infarction. Beta blockers, or drugs with beta blocking effects, are known to prevent sudden cardiac death. It was unclear if the cardiac nerves in the heart play only a passive role in the mechanisms of sudden death. To determine if nerve sprouting and neural remodeling occur after myocardial infarction, we performed immunocytochemical studies of cardiac nerves in explanted native hearts of transplant recipients. We found that there was a positive correlation between nerve density and a clinical history of ventricular arrhythmia. Encouraged by these results, we performed a study in dogs to determine whether or not nerve growth factor (NGF) infusion to the left stellate ganglion can facilitate the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The results showed that augmented myocardial sympathetic nerve sprouting through NGF infusion plus atrioventricular (AV) block and MI result in a 44% incidence (four of nine dogs) of SCD and a high incidence of VT in the chronic phase of MI. In contrast, none of the six dogs (with AV block and MI) without NGF infusion died suddenly or had frequent VT episodes. Based on these findings, we propose the nerve sprouting hypothesis of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD. The hypothesis states that MI results in nerve injury, followed by sympathetic nerve sprouting and regional (heterogeneous) myocardial hyperinnervation. The coupling between augmented sympathetic nerve sprouting with electrically remodeled myocardium results in VT, VF and SCD. Modification of nerve sprouting after MI may provide a novel opportunity for arrhythmia control. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Peng Sheng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lan S"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Ji Min"},{"family":"Sharifi","given":"Behrooz"},{"family":"Karagueuzian","given":"Hrayr S"},{"family":"Fishbein","given":"Michael C"}],"citation-key":"Chen2001","container-title":"Cardiovascular Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0008-6363(00)00308-4","ISSN":"00086363","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",5]]},"page":"409-416","PMID":"11334845","title":"Sympathetic nerve sprouting, electrical remodeling and the mechanisms of sudden cardiac death","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11334845","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"Chen2014","abstract":"Understanding of the taxonomy and phylogeny of Cryptococcus gattii has been advanced by modern molecular techniques. C. gattii probably diverged from Cryptococcus neoformans between 16 million and 160 million years ago, depending on the dating methods applied, and maintains diversity by recombining in nature. South America is the likely source of the virulent C. gattii VGII molecular types that have emerged in North America. C. gattii shares major virulence determinants with C. neoformans, although genomic and transcriptomic studies revealed that despite similar genomes, the VGIIa and VGIIb subtypes employ very different transcriptional circuits and manifest differences in virulence phenotypes. Preliminary evidence suggests that C. gattii VGII causes severe lung disease and death without dissemination, whereas C. neoformans disseminates readily to the central nervous system (CNS) and causes death from meningoencephalitis. Overall, currently available data indicate that the C. gattii VGI, VGII, and VGIII molecular types more commonly affect nonimmunocompromised hosts, in contrast to VGIV. New, rapid, cheap diagnostic tests and imaging modalities are assisting early diagnosis and enabling better outcomes of cerebral cryptococcosis. Complications of CNS infection include increased intracranial pressure, severe neurological sequelae, and development of immune reconstitution syndrome, although the mortality rate is low. C. gattii VGII isolates may exhibit higher fluconazole MICs than other genotypes. Optimal therapeutic regimens are yet to be determined; in most cases, initial therapy with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine is recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Sharon C.-A."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Wieland"},{"family":"Sorrell","given":"Tania C."}],"citation-key":"Chen2014","container-title":"Clinical microbiology reviews","DOI":"10.1128/CMR.00126-13","ISSN":"1098-6618","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,1]]},"page":"980-1024","PMID":"25278580","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology Journals","title":"Cryptococcus gattii infections.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278580","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"Cheniti2018","abstract":"AF is a heterogeneous rhythm disorder that is related to a wide spectrum of etiologies and has broad clinical presentations. Mechanisms underlying AF are complex and remain incompletely understood despite extensive research. They associate interactions between triggers, substrate and modulators including ionic and anatomic remodeling, genetic predisposition and neuro-humoral contributors. The pulmonary veins play a key role in the pathogenesis of AF and their isolation is associated to high rates of AF freedom in patients with paroxysmal AF. However, ablation of persistent AF remains less effective, mainly limited by the difficulty to identify the sources sustaining AF. Many theories were advanced to explain the perpetuation of this form of AF, ranging from a single localized focal and reentrant source to diffuse bi-atrial multiple wavelets. Translating these mechanisms to the clinical practice remains challenging and limited by the spatio-temporal resolution of the mapping techniques. AF is driven by focal or reentrant activities that are initially clustered in a relatively limited atrial surface then disseminate everywhere in both atria. Evidence for structural remodeling, mainly represented by atrial fibrosis suggests that reentrant activities using anatomical substrate are the key mechanism sustaining AF. These reentries can be endocardial, epicardial, and intramural which makes them less accessible for mapping and for ablation. Subsequently, early interventions before irreversible remodeling are of major importance. Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of the treatment of AF, regardless of the AF form and of the AF duration.

  {"id":"Cheshire2018","abstract":"© 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Signs of autonomic dysfunction, although at times seemingly mysterious, can contribute to diagnostic clarification and clinical investigation. Even when sophisticated autonomic testing equipment is not readily available, the experienced clinician, through educated observation and inductive reasoning—in conjunction with an intelligently obtained autonomic medical history—can discern much by a careful physical examination. Elements of the autonomic examination include variations in the pulse, postural measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, pupillary light reactions, skin coloration and temperature, patterns of sweating, and other organ-specific physical findings relevant to the individual patient’s presentation. Especially important is the often neglected practice of measuring the blood pressure standing up, for orthostatic hypotension cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and is a common source of potential morbidity. The examination should be carried out in the context of understanding the syndromic nature of abnormalities of components of the autonomic nervous system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheshire","given":"William P"},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"David S"}],"citation-key":"Cheshire2018","container-title":"Clinical Autonomic Research","DOI":"10.1007/s10286-017-0494-7","ISBN":"0123456789","ISSN":"16191560","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"23-33","title":"The physical examination as a window into autonomic disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10286-017-0494-7","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"chesnoy-marchais2009","abstract":"It is well known that progesterone is synthesised and metabolised within the nervous system, and that one of its metabolites, allopregnanolone, potentiates the activity of GABA receptor anionic channels and modulates GABAergic neurotransmission. Progesterone is now under clinical trial for its neuroprotective properties, but its possible effects on neurotransmission have not yet been fully explored. The present study investigated acute effects of progesterone on the other major type of synaptic inhibition, glycinergic neurotransmission. Spontaneous glycinergic miniature currents were recorded in hypoglossal motoneurons, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in rat brainstem slices. A 20-min superfusion with progesterone (1 mum) triggered an increase in the frequency of glycinergic miniatures, whereas no effect of progesterone was observed after block with finasteride (5 mum) of 5alpha -reductase, the first enzymatic step leading from progesterone to allopregnanolone. The effect of progesterone could be mimicked by superfusion with allopregnanolone (0.3 mum), whereas no effect was induced by epiallopregnanolone. Thus, progesterone can increase the synaptic miniature release of glycine and this effect appears to be indirect, resulting from its metabolism into 5alpha-reduced derivatives, in particular into allopregnanolone. A low concentration of an exogenous GABA(A) agonist can also increase the frequency of inhibitory miniature currents in hypoglossal motoneurons. Thus, the effects of progesterone and allopregnanolone on glycine release can be at least partly explained by the potentiation of the activity of depolarizing presynaptic GABA receptor channels. The increase in the tonic synaptic release of a major inhibitory neurotransmitter should reduce the excitability of the neurons and contribute to their protection against excitotoxicity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Chesnoy-Marchais","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"chesnoy-marchais2009","container-title":"The European Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Eur.

This study examined the relationships between personality and acute responses to stress in 125 healthy adults, using hierarchical linear regression. We assessed personality traits using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ-BF), and responses to acute stress (cortisol, heart rate, blood pressure, mood) using a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress task, the Trier Social Stress Test. Individuals with high Negative Emotionality exhibited greater emotional distress and lower blood pressure responses to the Trier Social Stress Test. Individuals with high agentic Positive Emotionality exhibited prolonged heart rate responses to stress, whereas those with high communal Positive Emotionality exhibited smaller cortisol and blood pressure responses. Separate personality traits differentially predicted emotional, cardiovascular, and cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor in healthy volunteers.

  {"id":"Cho2016","abstract":"RATIONALE: Central venous pressure (CVP) can be estimated by ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC), but imaging the IVC is sometimes challenging. The femoral vein is easily imaged by ultrasound and might therefore provide an alternate target for estimating CVP. OBJECTIVES: To assess femoral vein diameter (FVD) measured by ultrasound imaging for estimating CVP. METHODS: We prospectively measured CVP and FVD in 97 patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the ability of FVD to predict specific CVP values: less than 10 mm Hg, less than 8 mm Hg (low CVP), and greater than 12 mm Hg (high CVP). Interobserver variability of FVD measurement was assessed in 20 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was moderate correlation between FVD and CVP (r = 0.66, P < 0.001). FVD less than or equal to 0.8 cm was the best predictor of CVP < 10 mm Hg, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.894 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.82 to 0.97. FVD less than or equal to 0.7 cm performed best for predicting low CVP (AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99) and FVD greater than or equal to 1.0 cm for high CVP (AUC = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89). However, FVD greater than or equal to 1.2 cm had the greatest specificity (94%) for high CVP. Interobserver variability in FVD measurements was 8.3 +/- 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study suggest that the accuracy of FVD measured by ultrasound imaging for estimating CVP is comparable to that which has been reported for ultrasound measurement of IVC diameter. FVD may provide an alternative approach when the IVC is difficult to image. Additional studies on other cohorts of patients are warranted to validate our proposed FVD cutoff values for predicting low and high CVP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cho","given":"Roy J"},{"family":"Williams","given":"David R"},{"family":"Leatherman","given":"James W"}],"citation-key":"Cho2016","container-title":"Annals of the American Thoracic Society","DOI":"10.1513/AnnalsATS.201506-337BC","ISSN":"23256621","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"page":"81-85","PMID":"26561731","title":"Measurement of femoral vein diameter by ultrasound to estimate central venous pressure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201506-337BC","volume":"13"},

Young individuals with AF have a strong genetic association with the disease, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood.To perform large-scale whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants related to AF.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program includes longitudinal and cohort studies that underwent high-depth whole-genome sequencing between 2014 and 2017 in 18 526 individuals from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Barbados, and Samoa. This case-control study included 2781 patients with early-onset AF from 9 studies and identified 4959 controls of European ancestry from the remaining participants. Results were replicated in the UK Biobank (346 546 participants) and the MyCode Study (42 782 participants).Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in genes at AF loci and common genetic variation across the whole genome.Early-onset AF (defined as AF onset in persons &lt;66 years of age). Due to multiple testing, the significance threshold for the rare variant analysis was P = 4.55 × 10−3.Among 2781 participants with early-onset AF (the case group), 72.1% were men, and the mean (SD) age of AF onset was 48.7 (10.2) years. Participants underwent whole-genome sequencing at a mean depth of 37.8 fold and mean genome coverage of 99.1%. At least 1 LOF variant in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin, was present in 2.1% of case participants compared with 1.1% in control participants (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.04-2.97]). The proportion of individuals with early-onset AF who carried a LOF variant in TTN increased with an earlier age of AF onset (P value for trend, 4.92 × 10−4), and 6.5% of individuals with AF onset prior to age 30 carried a TTN LOF variant (OR, 5.94 [95% CI, 2.64-13.35]; P = 1.65 × 10−5). The association between TTN LOF variants and AF was replicated in an independent study of 1582 patients with early-onset AF (cases) and 41 200 control participants (OR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.19-3.92]; P = .01).In a case-control study, there was a statistically significant association between an LOF variant in the TTN gene and early-onset AF, with the variant present in a small percentage of participants with early-onset AF (the case group). Further research is necessary to understand whether this is a causal relationship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Seung Hoan"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Lu-Chen"},{"family":"Roselli","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Honghuang"},{"family":"Haggerty","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Shoemaker","given":"M.

  {"id":"christensen2007","abstract":"Background: Prolonged use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in neonates can lead to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), manifested by elevated direct bilirubin concentrations, and in some cases progressing to hepatic failure. When new potential means of preventing PNALD in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), such as Omegaven usage, are tested in clinical trials, the studies should enroll neonates at a very high risk of developing PNALD. However, it is not always clear, in the first days of life, which neonates are most likely to develop PNALD. Therefore, preparatory to devising studies of prophylaxis against PNALD, we conducted an evaluation of all NICU patients who received PN for 14 day, assessing their likelihood of developing PNALD.\nMethods: We performed an historic cohort analysis of all neonates in the Intermountain Healthcare system, receiving PN for 14 days or more during their stay, with dates of birth between 1 January, 2002 and 30 June, 2006.\nResults: During the 4½-year period, 9861 neonates were cared for in the Intermountain Healthcare NICUs. Of these, 9547 (96.8%) survived for at least 28 days, and of these 6543 (68.5%) received PN. Twenty-one percent (1366 patients) of those receiving PN, received it for 14 days. PNALD was ascertained in this group by a direct bilirubin 2.0 mg/dl. Neonates receiving PN for 14–28 days had a 14% incidence of PNALD, those receiving PN for 29–56 days had a 43% incidence, those receiving PN for 57–100 days had a 72% incidence and those receiving PN for >100 days had a 85% incidence. Groups of patients identifiable on the first day of life as having the highest risk of developing PNALD were birth weight <500 g (odds ratio (OR), 30.7), birth weight 500–749 g (OR, 13.1), gastrochisis (OR, 20.3) and jejunal atresia (OR, 24.0). Among 357 patients who developed PNALD, the highest direct bilirubin concentrations correlated with the highest serum alkaline phosphatase and transaminase concentrations. Deaths after 28 days were much more common in those with the highest direct bilirubin and transaminase concentrations (P<0.0001).\nConclusions: In the first days of life, certain NICU patients can be identified as being at very high risk for developing PNALD. These are patients <750 g birth weight, those with gastrochisis and those with jejunal atresia. We speculate that these groups would be reasonable subjects for including in a PNALD prophylaxis trial, testing new preventative strategies such as Omegaven usage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"R.

  {"id":"Chugh2001","abstract":"With a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, the growing “epidemic” of atrial fibrillation (AF) intersects with a number of conditions, including aging, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction. Currently, the epidemiology and natural history of AF govern all aspects of its clinical management. The ongoing global investigative efforts toward understanding AF are also driven by epidemiologic findings. New developments, by affecting the natural history of the disease, could eventually alter the nature of decision making in patients with AF. The crucial issue of rate versus rhythm control awaits completion of the AF Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial. The processes of electrical and structural remodeling that perpetuate AF appear to be reversible. In the era of functional genomics, the molecular basis of this ubiquitous arrhythmia is in the process of being defined. Unraveling the molecular genetics of AF might provide new insights into the structural and electrical phenotypes resulting from genetic mutations and, as such, new approaches to treatment of this arrhythmia at the ion channel and cellular levels. Thus, current adverse trends are superimposed on a background of a rapidly developing knowledge base and potentially exciting new therapeutic options. Consequently, an understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of AF is crucial to the future allocation of resources and the utilization of an expanding range of therapies aimed at reducing the impact of this disease on a changing patient population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Chugh","given":"Sumeet S"},{"family":"Blackshear","given":"Joseph L"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Win-Kuang"},{"family":"Hammill","given":"Stephen C"},{"family":"Gersh","given":"Bernard J"}],"citation-key":"Chugh2001","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","container-title-short":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/S0735-1097(00)01107-4","ISSN":"0735-1097","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"371-378","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Epidemiology and natural history of atrial fibrillation: clinical implications","title-short":"Epidemiology and natural history of atrial fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109700011074","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"Clifford2002","abstract":"Heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate calculated from the electrocar- diogram (ECG), is a key indicator of an individual’s cardiovascular condition. Assessment of HRV has been shown to aid clinical diagnosis and intervention strategies. However, the variety of HRV estima- tion methods and contradictory reports in this field indicate that there is a need for a more rigorous investigation of these methods as aids to clinical evaluation. This thesis investigates the development of appropriate HRV signal processing techniques in the context of pilot studies in two fields of potential application, sleep and head-up tilting (HUT). A novel method for characterising normality in the ECG using both timing information and morpho- logical characteristics is presented. A neural network, used to learn the beat-to-beat variations in ECG waveform morphology, is shown to provide a highly sensitive technique for identifying normal beats. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based frequency-domain HRV techniques, which require re-sampling of the inherently unevenly sampled heart beat time-series (RR tachogram) to produce an evenly sampled time series, are then explored using a newmethod for producing an artificial RRtachogram. Re-sampling is shown to produce a significant error in the estimation of an (entirely specified) artificial RR tachogram. The Lomb periodogram, a method which requires no re-sampling and is applicable to the unevenly sampled nature of the signal is investigated. Experiments demonstrate that the Lomb periodogram is superior to the FFT for evaluating HRV measured by the ?? -ratio, a ratio of the low to high frequency ?? power in the RR tachogram within a specified band (0.04–0.4Hz). The effect of adding artificial ectopic beats in the RR tachogram is then considered and it is shown that ectopic beats significantly alter the spectrum and therefore must be removed or replaced. Replacing ectopic beats by phantom beats is compared to the case of ectopic-realted RR interval removal for the FFT and Lomb methods for varying levels of ectopy. The Lomb periodogram is shown to provide a significantly better estimate of the ?? - ?? ratio under these conditions and is a robust method for measuring the ?? -ratio in the presence of (a ?? possibly unknown number of) ectopic beats or artefacts. The Lomb periodogram and FFT-based techniques are applied to a database of sleep apn ? ic and normal subjects. A new method of assessing HRVduring sleep is proposed to minimise the confounding effects on HRV of changes due to changing mental activity. Estimation of ?? -ratio using the Lomb ?? technique is shown to separate these two patient groups more effectively than with FFT-based techniques. Results are also presented for the application of these methods to controlled (HUT) studies on subjects with syncope, an autonomic nervous system problem, which indicate that the techniques developed in this thesis may provide a method for differentiating between sub-classes of syncope","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Gari D"}],"citation-key":"Clifford2002","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"number-of-pages":"1-244","title":"Signal Processing Methods For Heart Rate Variability Analysis","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:5129701f-1d40-425a-99a3-59a05e8c1b23/datastreams/THESIS01"},
  {"id":"Clifford2005","abstract":"Spectral estimates of heart rate variability (HRV) often involve the use of techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), which require an evenly sampled time series. HRV is calculated from the variations in the beat-to-beat (RR) interval timing of the cardiac cycle which are inherently irregularly spaced in time. In order to produce an evenly sampled time series prior to FFT-based spectral estimation, linear or cubic spline resampling is usually employed. In this paper, by using a realistic artificial RR interval generator, interpolation and resampling is shown to result in consistent over-estimations of the power spectral density (PSD) compared with the theoretical solution. The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, a more appropriate spectral estimation technique for unevenly sampled time series that uses only the original data, is shown to provide a superior PSD estimate. Ectopy removal or replacement is shown to be essential regardless of the spectral estimation technique. Resampling and phantom beat replacement is shown to decrease the accuracy of PSD estimation, even at low levels of ectopy or artefact. A linear relationship between the frequency of ectopy/artefact and the error (mean and variance) of the PSD estimate is demonstrated. Comparisons of PSD estimation techniques performed on real RR interval data during minimally active segments (sleep) demonstrate that the LS periodogram provides a less noisy spectral estimate of HRV.","author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Gari D."},{"family":"Tarassenko","given":"Lionel"}],"citation-key":"Clifford2005","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","DOI":"10.1109/TBME.2005.844028","ISBN":"0018-9294","ISSN":"00189294","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"630-638","PMID":"15825865","title":"Quantifying errors in spectral estimates of HRV due to beat replacement and resampling","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},

Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article, we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD, focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD.

Risk factors for developing short bowel syndrome as a result of partial bowel resection (surgical short bowel syndrome) and outcomes were evaluated for all neonates until hospital discharge, death, or 120 days. Extremely low birth weight survivors were further evaluated at 18 to 22 months’ corrected age for feeding methods and growth.\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of surgical short bowel syndrome in this cohort of 12 316 very low birth weight infants was 0.7%. Necrotizing enterocolitis was the most common diagnosis associated with surgical short bowel syndrome. More very low birth weight infants with short bowel syndrome (20%) died during initial hospitalization than those without necrotizing enterocolitis or short bowel syndrome (12%) but fewer than the infants with surgical necrotizing enterocolitis without short bowel syndrome (53%). Among 5657 extremely low birth weight infants, the incidence of surgical short bowel syndrome was 1.1%. At 18 to 22 months, extremely low birth weight infants with short bowel syndrome were more likely to still require tube feeding (33%) and to have been rehospitalized (79%). Moreover, these infants had growth delay with shorter lengths and smaller head circumferences than infants without necrotizing enterocolitis or short bowel syndrome.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nShort bowel syndrome is rare in neonates but has a high mortality rate. At 18 to 22 months’ corrected age, extremely low birth weight infants with short bowel syndrome were more likely to have growth failure than infants without short bowel syndrome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Conrad R."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Nellie I."},{"family":"Higgins","given":"Rosemary D."},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Stoll","given":"Barbara J."}],"citation-key":"cole2008","container-title":"Pediatrics","container-title-short":"Pediatrics","DOI":"10.1542/peds.2007-3449","ISSN":"0031-4005","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9]]},"page":"e573-e582","PMCID":"PMC2848527","PMID":"18762491","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants With Surgical Short Bowel Syndrome: Incidence, Morbidity and Mortality, and Growth Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months","title-short":"Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants With Surgical Short Bowel Syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848527/","volume":"122"},
  {"id":"Collister2022","abstract":"A polygenic risk score estimates the genetic risk of an individual for some disease or trait, calculated by aggregating the effect of many common variants associated with the condition. With the increasing availability of genetic data in large cohort studies such as the UK Biobank, inclusion of this genetic risk as a covariate in statistical analyses is becoming more widespread. Previously this required specialist knowledge, but as tooling and data availability have improved it has become more feasible for statisticians and epidemiologists to calculate existing scores themselves for use in analyses. While tutorial resources exist for conducting genome-wide association studies and generating of new polygenic risk scores, fewer guides exist for the simple calculation and application of existing genetic scores. This guide outlines the key steps of this process: selection of suitable polygenic risk scores from the literature, extraction of relevant genetic variants and verification of their quality, calculation of the risk score and key considerations of its inclusion in statistical models, using the UK Biobank imputed data as a model data set. Many of the techniques in this guide will generalize to other datasets, however we also focus on some of the specific techniques required for using data in the formats UK Biobank have selected. This includes some of the challenges faced when working with large numbers of variants, where the computation time required by some tools is impractical. While we have focused on only a couple of tools, which may not be the best ones for every given aspect of the process, one barrier to working with genetic data is the sheer volume of tools available, and the difficulty for a novice to assess their viability. By discussing in depth a couple of tools that are adequate for the calculation even at large scale, we hope to make polygenic risk scores more accessible to a wider range of researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Collister","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaonan"},{"family":"Clifton","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"Collister2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Genetics","ISSN":"1664-8021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Calculating Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) in UK Biobank: A Practical Guide for Epidemiologists","title-short":"Calculating Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) in UK Biobank","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.818574","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"Connolly2000","abstract":"Background - Patients surviving ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are at a high risk of death due to a recurrence of arrhythmia. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) terminates VT or VF, but it is not known whether this device prolongs life in these patients compared with medical therapy with amiodarone. Methods and Results - A total of 659 patients with resuscitated VF or VT or with unmonitored syncope were randomly assigned to treatment with the ICD or with amiodarone. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was arrhythmic death. A total of 328 patients were randomized to receive an ICD. A thoracotomy was done in 33, no ICD was implanted in 18, and the rest had a nonthoracotomy ICD. All 331 patients randomized to amiodarone received it initially. At 5 years, 85.4% of patients assigned to amiodarone were still receiving it at a mean dose of 255 mg/day, 28.1% of ICD patients were also receiving amiodarone, and 21.4% of amiodarone patients had received an ICD. A nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death was observed with the ICD, from 10.2% per year to 8.3% per year (19.7% relative risk reduction; 95% confidence interval, -7.7% to 40%; P = 0.142).

  {"id":"Connolly2000b","abstract":"Aims: Three randomized trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy vs medical treatment for the prevention of death in survivors of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia have been reported with what might appear to be different results. The present analysis was performed to obtain the most precise estimate of the efficacy of the ICD, compared to amiodarone, for prolonging survival in patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Methods and Results: Individual patient data from the Antiarrhythmics vs Implantable Defibrillator (AVID) study, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH) and the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) were merged into a master database according to a pre-specified protocol. Proportional hazard modelling of individual patient data was used to estimate hazard ratios and to investigate subgroup interactions. Fixed effect meta-analysis techniques were also used to evaluate treatment effects and to assess heterogeneity across studies. The classic fixed effects meta-analysis showed that the estimates of ICD benefit from the three studies were consistent with each other (P heterogeneity=0.306). It also showed a significant reduction in death from any cause with the ICD; with a summary hazard ratio (ICD:amiodarone) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.60, 0.87; P=0.0006). For the outcome of arrhythmic death, the hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% confidence interval 0.37, 0.67; P<0.0001). Survival was extended by a mean of 4.4 months by the ICD over a follow-up period of 6 years. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥35% derived significantly more benefit from ICD therapy than those with better preserved left ventricular function. Patients treated before the availability of non-thoracotomy ICD implants derived significantly less benefit from ICD therapy than those treated in the non-thoracotomy era. Conclusion: Results from the three trials of the ICD vs amiodarone are consistent with each other. There is a 28% reduction in the relative risk of death with the ICD that is due almost entirely to a 50% reduction in arrhythmic death.

  {"id":"Coote2013","abstract":"There is continuing belief that cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres are sparse or absent from the ventricles. This review of the literature shows that the supposition is a myth. Early studies considered that fine silver-stained fibres coursing amongst ventricle myocardial cells were most likely cardiac parasympathetic postganglionic fibres. The conclusions were later supported by acetyl cholinesterase staining using a method that appeared not to be associated with noradrenaline nerve fibres. The conclusion is critically examined in the light of several recent histological studies using the acetyl cholinesterase method and also a more definitive technique (CHAT), that suggest a widespread location of parasympathetic ganglia and a relatively dense parasympathetic innervation of ventricular muscle in a range of mammals including man. The many studies demonstrating acetylcholine release in the ventricle on vagal nerve stimulation and a high density of acetylcholine M2 receptors is in accord with this as are tests of ventricular performance from many physiological studies. Selective control of cardiac functions by anatomically segregated parasympathetic ganglia is discussed. It is argued that the influence of vagal stimulation on ventricular myocardial action potential refractory period, duration, force and rhythm is evidence that vagal fibres have close apposition to myocardial fibres. This is supported by clear evidence of accentuated antagonism between sympathetic activity and vagal activity in the ventricle and also by direct effects of vagal activity independent of sympathetic activity. The idea of differential control of atrial and ventricular physiology by vagal C and vagal B preganglionic fibres is examined as well as differences in chemical phenotypes and their function. The latter is reflected in medullary and supramedullary control. Reference is made to the importance of this knowledge to understanding the normal physiology of cardiac autonomic control and significance to pathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Coote","given":"J H"}],"citation-key":"Coote2013","container-title":"Journal of Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/jphysiol.2013.257758","ISBN":"1469-7793 (Electronic)\\r0022-3751 (Linking)","ISSN":"00223751","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"4073-4085","PMID":"23878363","title":"Myths and realities of the cardiac vagus","type":"article-journal","volume":"591"},
  {"id":"Coote2016a","abstract":"Autonomic control of the heart has a significant influence over development of life threatening arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Sympathetic activity is known to be upregulated during these conditions and hence the sympathetic nerves present a target for treatment. However, a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac sympathetic nerves is required for the progression of clinical interventions. This review explores the organization of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, from the preganglionic origin to the postganglionic innervations, and provides an overview of literature surrounding anti-arrhythmic therapies including thoracic sympathectomy and dorsal spinal cord stimulation. Several features of the innervation are clear. The cardiac nerves differentially supply the nodal and myocardial tissue of the heart and are dependent on activity generated in spinal neurones in the upper thoracic cord which project to synapse with ganglion cells in the stellate complex on each side. Networks of spinal interneurones determine the pattern of activity. Groups of spinal neurones selectively target specific regions of the heart but whether they exhibit a functional selectivity has still to be elucidated. Electrical or ischemic signals can lead to remodeling of nerves in the heart or ganglia. Surgical and electrical methods are proving to be clinically beneficial in reducing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and severe cardiac pain. This is a rapidly developing area and we need more basic understanding of how these methods work to ensure safety and reduction of side effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Coote","given":"J.

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes). © 2014 Cornelissen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cornelissen","given":"Germaine"}],"citation-key":"Cornelissen2014","container-title":"Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling","DOI":"10.1186/1742-4682-11-16","ISSN":"17424682","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,11]]},"page":"16","PMID":"24725531","publisher":"BioMed Central","title":"Cosinor-based rhythmometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725531","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"Corpas2013","abstract":"Background The availability of open access genomic data is essential for the personal genomics field. Public genomic data allow comparative analyses, testing of new tools and genotype-phenotype association studies. Personal genomics data of unrelated individuals are available in the public domain, notably the Personal Genome Project; however, to date genomics family data and metadata are severely lacking, mainly due to cost, privacy concerns or restricted access to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology. Family data have a lot to offer as they allow the study of heritability, something which is impossible to do just by using unrelated individuals.\nFindings A whole family from Southern Spain decided to genotype, sequence and analyse their personal genomes making them publicly available under a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0; commonly denominated as public domain). These data include a) five 23andMe SNP chip genotype bed files, b) four raw exomes with their assorted bam files and VCF files, c) a metagenomic raw sequencing data file and d) derived data of likely phenotypes using SNPedia-derived tools.\nConclusions To our knowledge this is the first CC0 released set of genomic, phenotypic and metagenomic data for a whole family. This dataset is also unique in that it was obtained through direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Hence any ordinary citizen with enough budget and samples should be able to reproduce this experiment. We envisage this dataset to be a useful resource for a variety of applications in the personal genomics field as a) negative control data for trait association discovery, b) testing data for development of new software and c) sample data for heritability studies. We encourage prospective users to share with us derived results so that they can be added to our existing collection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Corpas","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Cariaso","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Coletta","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"David"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Moran","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Huanming"}],"citation-key":"Corpas2013","DOI":"10.1101/000216","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,12]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2013, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Electrophysiological studies have defined multiple mechanisms of tachycardia, both re-entrant and focal, with varying ECG morphologies and rates, authenticated by the results of catheter ablation of the focal triggers or critical isthmuses of re-entry circuits. In patients without a history of heart disease, cardiac surgery or catheter ablation, typical flutter ECG remains predictive of a right atrial re-entry circuit dependent on the inferior vena cava–tricuspid isthmus that can be very effectively treated by ablation, although late incidence of atrial fibrillation remains a problem. Secondary prevention, based on the treatment of associated atrial fibrillation risk factors, is emerging as a therapeutic option. In patients subjected to cardiac surgery or catheter ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or showing atypical ECG patterns, macro-re-entrant and focal tachycardia mechanisms can be very complex and electrophysiological studies are necessary to guide ablation treatment in poorly tolerated cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cosío","given":"Francisco G"}],"citation-key":"Cosio2017","container-title":"Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology Review","DOI":"10.15420/aer.2017.5.2","ISSN":"2050-3369","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"page":"55","PMID":"28835836","publisher":"Radcliffe Cardiology","title":"Atrial Flutter, Typical and Atypical: A Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835836","volume":"6"},

The former tends to favour macro-reentry phenomena whereas the latter favours abnormal automaticity and triggered activity. In normal hearts vagal influences are predominant, thus explaining that the clinical pattern of vagal-mediated paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is preferentially observed in the absence of detectable heart disease, in young male adults, with an ECG pattern of common flutter alternating with fibrillation. Symathetically mediated atrial fibrillation is observed in the presence of any heart disease, the first effect of which is to provoke a vagal withdrawal. The clinical history is a reliable guide for suspecting which type of physiological autonomic predominance contributes to destabilize the arrhythmogenic substrate, but observing the behaviour of sinus rate variability just preceding the onset of the arrhythmia only permits documentation of the mechanism. The role of the autonomic influences should be taken into consideration every time conventional antiarrhythmic treatment is insufficient. Beta-blockers as well as digitalis may be either beneficial or detrimental, according to the causal mechanism, so that the choice of their use as a single or a combined therapy should be appropriate.","author":[{"family":"Coumel","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Coumel1994","container-title":"European Heart Journal","container-title-short":"Eur Heart J","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/15.suppl_a.9","ISSN":"0195-668X","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"9-16","PMID":"8070496","source":"PubMed","title":"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a disorder of autonomic tone?","title-short":"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","type":"article-journal","volume":"15 Suppl A"},

Significant group by trial interaction effects was found for systolic blood pressure following administration of verbal fluency [F(1,54) = 5.86, p < 0.05] and nonverbal fluency stressors [F(1,54) = 13.68, p < .001].

Given the association between anger and negative physical health outcomes, there is a clear need to better understand the physiological components of anger.

To establish its origin, an intracoronary infusion of increasing adenosine concentrations was given in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris. During adenosine infusion, 20 patients had chest pain without electrocardiographic signs of ischemia. They all reported that the chest pain was similar to their usual anginal pain. In 10 of the 22 patients adenosine was also infused into the right atrium, but it never produced symptoms at the doses that had provoked chest pain during intracoronary infusion. In seven other patients, the intracoronary adenosine infusion was repeated after intravenous administration of aminophylline, an antagonist of adenosine P1-receptors. Aminophylline decreased the severity of adenosine-induced chest pain (assessed with a visual analog scale) from 42 +/- 22 to 23 +/- 17 mm (p less than 0.002). In the remaining five of the 22 patients, monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the coronary sinus during intracoronary adenosine administration showed that maximum coronary vasodilation was achieved at doses lower than those responsible for chest pain. A single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effect of aminophylline on exercise-induced chest pain was also performed in 20 other patients with stable angina. Aminophylline, compared with placebo, decreased the severity of chest pain at peak exercise from 67 +/- 21 to 51 +/- 23 mm (p less than 0.02), despite the achievement of a similar degree of ST-segment depression.

A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with enrollment and follow-up occurring between November 2005 and December 2007. A diverse community sample of 48 HIV-1 infected adults was randomized and entered treatment in either an 8-week MBSR or a 1-day control stress reduction education seminar.

Participants in the 1-day control seminar showed declines in CD4+ T lymphocyte counts whereas counts among participants in the 8-week MBSR program were unchanged from baseline to post-intervention (timextreatment condition interaction, p=.02). This effect was independent of antiretroviral (ARV) medication use. Additional analyses indicated that treatment adherence to the mindfulness meditation program, as measured by class attendance, mediated the effects of mindfulness meditation training on buffering CD4+ T lymphocyte declines.

  {"id":"CRICK1999","abstract":"This study was prompted by the prospect of transgenic pigs providing donor hearts for transplantation in human recipients. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60-70% of the total pattern of innervation in the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37% of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25% in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves represented 8-9% of the total innervation of the nodal tissues and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14-19% in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4-13% of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the nodal tissues could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart. It is important that we are aware of these findings in view of the future use of transgenic pig hearts in human xenotransplantation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Crick","given":"S J"},{"family":"Sheppard","given":"M N"},{"family":"Ho","given":"S Y"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"R H"}],"citation-key":"CRICK1999","container-title":"Journal of anatomy","DOI":"10.1046/j.1469-7580.1999.19530341.x","ISSN":"0021-8782","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",10]]},"page":"341-57","PMID":"10580850","title":"Localisation and quantitation of autonomic innervation in the porcine heart I: conduction system.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.1469-7580.1999.19530359.x","volume":"195 ( Pt 3"},

Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics and there is evidence suggesting that some neurons remain intact after transplantation. Previous studies in the human heart have established regional differences in both general autonomic innervation and in its component neural subpopulations. Such studies are lacking in the pig heart. Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the pattern of innervation in pig hearts (Sus scrofa). Gradients of immunoreactivity for the general neural marker protein gene product 9.5 were observed both within and between the endocardial, myocardial and epicardial plexuses throughout the 4 cardiac chambers. An extensive ganglionated plexus was observed in the epicardial tissues and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardial tissues. The predominant neural subpopulation displayed acetylcholinesterase activity, throughout the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. These nerves showed a right to left gradient in density in the endocardial plexus, which was not observed in either the myocardial or epicardial plexuses. A large proportion of nerves in the ganglionated plexus of the atrial epicardial tissues displayed AChE activity, together with their cell bodies. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive nerves were the next most prominent subpopulation throughout the heart. TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the atrial ganglionated plexuses. Endocardial TH- and NPY-immunoreactive nerves also displayed a right to left gradient in density, whereas in the epicardial tissues they showed a ventricular to atrial gradient. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-immunoreactive nerves were the most abundant peptide-containing subpopulation after those possessing NPY immunoreactivity. They were most abundant in the epicardial tissues of the ventricles. Several important differences were observed between the innervation of the pig heart compared with the human heart.

  {"id":"Crow2003","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is the traditional method of assessing the duration of repolarization. Prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval is associated with higher risk of mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and in the general population. However, the QTc is typically not evaluated when QRS duration is > or =120 ms, because increased QRS duration (QRSd) contributes to QT interval prolongation. In these circumstances, the JT interval has been proposed as a more valid way to assess ventricular repolarization. METHODS AND RESULTS: To allow for variation in heart rate, corrected JT interval (JTc) was defined as QTc-QRSd. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, JTc and QTc were compared for their prognostic associations with incident CHD events among 14 696 men and women who were CHD-free at baseline, having either normal conduction or wide QRS complex. Among individuals with normal QRS duration, logistic regression adjusted for age, hypertensive status, diabetes, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking, HDL and LDL cholesterol, R-R interval, and menopausal status in women showed QTc and JTc were nonpredictive of future coronary events in men but significant in women. In individuals with wide QRS complex (QRSd > or =120 ms), similar analyses showed JTc had a significant prognostic advantage compared with QTc in men but not in women, among whom only 11 events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The JTc is a simple measurement that is a significant independent predictor of incident CHD events in men with wide QRS complex.","author":[{"family":"Crow","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Hannan","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Folsom","given":"Aaron R."}],"citation-key":"Crow2003","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000095027.28753.9D","ISBN":"1524-4539 (Electronic)\\r0009-7322 (Linking)","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"1985-1989","PMID":"14517173","title":"Prognostic Significance of Corrected QT and Corrected JT Interval for Incident Coronary Heart Disease in a General Population Sample Stratified by Presence or Absence of Wide QRS Complex: The ARIC Study With 13 Years of Follow-Up","type":"article-journal","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"Crystal2012a","abstract":"Francis A. Bainbridge demonstrated in 1915 that an infusion of saline or blood into the jugular vein of the anesthetized dog produced tachycardia. His findings after transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of the cholinergic blocking drug atropine demonstrated that the tachycardia was reflex in origin, with the vagus nerves constituting the afferent limb and a withdrawal of vagal tone the primary efferent limb. Subsequent investigators demonstrated that the increase in venous return was detected by stretch receptors in the right and left atria. In the 1980s, it was shown convincingly that the Bainbridge reflex was present in primates, including humans, but that the reflex was much less prominent than in the dog. This difference may be due to a more dominant arterial baroreceptor reflex in humans. A \"reverse\" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage. The Bainbridge reflex is invoked throughout the anesthesia literature to describe the effect of changes in venous return on heart rate in patients in the surgical and critical care settings, but a critical analysis of the experimental and clinical evidence is lacking. Our main objectives in this review are to summarize the history of the Bainbridge reflex, to describe its anatomy and physiology, and to discuss the evidence for and against it having an influence on heart rate changes observed clinically.

  {"id":"Cui2019","abstract":"Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is a frequently performed procedure in patients with atrial fibrillation. Prior studies have shown that the RFCA may directly stimulate vagal afferents during the procedure, whereas the vagal tone assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) is lowered weeks after the RFCA procedure. The effects of RFCA performed in the left atrium on sympathetic nerve activity have not been assessed. In the present study, we hypothesized that RFCA would lower muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) during ablation and would raise MSNA 1 day postablation. A total of 18 patients were studied. In protocol 1 ( n = 10), electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and MSNA in the peroneal nerve were recorded through the RFCA procedure performed in the electrophysiology laboratory. In protocol 2, eight patients were studied before the procedure and 1 day postablation. RFCA led to a decrease in MSNA immediately after the procedure (25.4 ± 3.2 to 17.2 ± 3.8 bursts/min, P < 0.05). Cardiac parasympathetic activity was determined using indexes of HRV and increased during the procedure. One day postablation, MSNA was above baseline values (21.3 ± 3.7 to 35.7 ± 2.6 bursts/min, P < 0.05). HRV indexes of cardiac parasympathetic activity fell, and the HRV index of sympathovagal balance was not significantly altered. The results show that RFCA raised cardiac parasympathetic activity and decreased MSNA during the procedure. One day postablation, MSNA rose and cardiac parasympathetic activity fell. In addition, RFCA evokes differentiated sympathetic responses directed to the heart and skeletal muscles. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The effects of radiofrequency catheter ablation performed in the left atrium on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) have not been assessed. The results of this study show that radiofrequency catheter ablation raised cardiac parasympathetic activity and decreased MSNA during the procedure.

  {"id":"Culley2019","abstract":"editor ANESTHESIOLOGY, V XXX • NO XXX XXX 2019 1 T horacic epidural anesthesia is widely applied in tho-racic and abdominal surgical procedures, because it provides excellent analgesia and decreases postoperative pulmonary complications. 1,2 Epidural anesthesia with local anesthetics produces sensory and motor blockade but also affects the autonomic nervous system. The resultant effects on the cardiovascular system vary with the level and the extent of sympathetic blockade. Involvement of the lower thoracic region (T6 to L1) by thoracic epidural anesthesia is associated with increased venous capacitance and redistribution of blood to the dilated splanchnic veins. This results in decreased venous return to the heart and a reduction of cardiac preload. 3 Arterial vasodilation in blocked segments is counteracted by compensatory vasoconstriction in unblocked segments, and the effect on cardiac afterload depends on the balance between blocked and unblocked segments. 4 Direct effects of cardiac sympatholysis have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Many studies quantified the cardiac effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia using load-dependent indices of contractile performance, which does not allow differentiation between direct and indirect effects. Regardless, the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia have generally been considered beneficial to the cardiovascular system and protective against surgical stress. 5 Interestingly, recent systematic reviews have not been able to confirm improved cardiac outcome in surgical patients treated with thoracic epidural anesthesia. 6 In contrast, some evidence was found for increased cardiovascular problems in high-risk patients receiving neuraxial block. 7,8 In light of these concerns, a reappraisal of the cardiovascular effects associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia seems appropriate. Since the last published review on this subject, 9 new data have emerged from experimental and clinical studies addressing previously unexplored domains such as the effects of cardiac sympathectomy on right ven-tricular function, an important determinant of outcome in surgery. 10-12 We conducted the present review to update the knowledge in this field, with focus on the effects associated with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympa-thectomy in the normal and diseased cardiovascular system. Materials and Methods The databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched by the author and by an independent expert librarian to identify studies in which the cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1 to T5) are involved in neural blockade by thoracic epidural anesthesia. An extensive list of used ABStRAct Cardiac sympathetic blockade with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia is considered beneficial in patients undergoing major surgery because it offers protection in ischemic heart disease. Major outcome studies have failed to confirm such a benefit, however. In fact, there is growing concern about potential harm associated with the use of thoracic epidural anesthesia in high-risk patients, although underlying mechanisms have not been identified. Since the latest review on this subject, a number of clinical and experimental studies have provided new information on the complex interaction between thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis and cardiovascular control mechanisms. Perhaps these new insights may help identify conditions in which benefits of thoracic epidural anesthesia may not outweigh potential risks. For example, cardiac sympathectomy with high-thoracic epidural anesthesia decreases right ventricular function and attenuates its capacity to cope with increased right ventricular afterload. Although the clinical significance of this pathophysiologic interaction is unknown at present, it identifies a subgroup of patients with established or pending pulmonary hypertension for whom outcome studies are needed. Other new areas of interest include the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia-induced sympatholysis on cardiovascular control in conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, surgical stress, and hemodynamic disruption. It was considered appropriate to collect and analyze all recent scientific information on this subject to provide a comprehensive update on the cardiovascular effects of high-thoracic epidural anesthesia and cardiac sympathectomy in healthy and diseased patients.","author":[{"family":"Wink","given":"Jeroen"},{"family":"Veering","given":"Bernadette T"},{"family":"Aarts","given":"Leon P H J"},{"family":"Wouters","given":"Patrick F"},{"family":"Culley","given":"Deborah J"},{"family":"Wink","given":"Jeroen"},{"family":"Veering","given":"Bernadette T"},{"family":"Aarts","given":"Leon P H J"},{"family":"Wouters","given":"Patrick F"}],"citation-key":"Culley2019","container-title":"Anesthesiology","DOI":"10.1097/ALN.0000000000002558","ISSN":"0003-3022","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"page":"472-491","title":"Effects of Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia on Neuronal Cardiac Regulation and Cardiac Function","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00000542-201903000-00026","volume":"130"},
  {"id":"Cunha2016","abstract":"Summary Since first identified in early 1977, bacteria of the genus Legionella are recognised as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a rare cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Legionella bacteria multisystem manifestations mainly affect susceptible patients as a result of age, underlying debilitating conditions, or immunosuppression. Water is the major natural reservoir for Legionella, and the pathogen is found in many different natural and artificial aquatic environments such as cooling towers or water systems in buildings, including hospitals. The term given to the severe pneumonia and systemic infection caused by Legionella bacteria is Legionnaires' disease. Over time, the prevalence of legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease has risen, which might indicate a greater awareness and reporting of the disease. Advances in microbiology have led to a better understanding of the ecological niches and pathogenesis of the condition. Legionnaires' disease is not always suspected because of its non-specific symptoms, and the diagnostic tests routinely available do not offer the desired sensitivity. However, effective antibiotics are available. Disease notification systems provide the basis for initiating investigations and limiting the scale and recurrence of outbreaks. This report reviews our current understanding of this disease.","author":[{"family":"Cunha","given":"Burke A."},{"family":"Burillo","given":"Almudena"},{"family":"Bouza","given":"Emilio"}],"citation-key":"Cunha2016","container-title":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60078-2","ISBN":"9789401798761","ISSN":"1474547X","issue":"10016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"376-385","PMID":"26231463","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Legionnaires' disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60078-2","volume":"387"},
  {"id":"Curry2018","abstract":"IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Curry","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"Krist","given":"Alex H."},{"family":"Owens","given":"Douglas K."},{"family":"Barry","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Caughey","given":"Aaron B."},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Karina W."},{"family":"Doubeni","given":"Chyke A."},{"family":"Epling","given":"John W."},{"family":"Kemper","given":"Alex R."},{"family":"Kubik","given":"Martha"},{"family":"Landefeld","given":"C.

  {"id":"Dammacco2001","abstract":"Cryoglobulins are cold-precipitable immunoglobulins associated with a number of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Their appearance along with rheumatoid factor (RF) can be considered a normal event in the clearance of immune complexes and rarely produces any symptoms. The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) has been rendered evident since the recognition of serological markers of HCV infection. There is thus every reason to suppose that direct or indirect involvement of B cells on the part of the HCV results in their persistent stimulation, clonal expansion and release of molecules with RF activity. The formation of RF/IgG immune complexes is the key pathogenetic mechanism. The close correlation between HCV infection and MC also throws new light on the interpretation of autoimmune phenomena in the course of viral infection and on the close link between autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative disorders. The higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) displayed by HCV positive subjects, especially in the Mediterranean basin, suggests that the HCV's chronic lymphoproliferative drive may progress towards frank lymphoid neoplasia. The presence of MC does not represent an in situ or 'occult' NHL, because recent evidences indicate that none of the clones interpreted as predominant displays the molecular features of a true neoplastic process. The cryoglobulinemic syndrome is probably the consequence of pathogenic noxae that act upon the immune system of a host in which regulation of the peripheral T cell response appears to be in some way altered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dammacco","given":"F."},{"family":"Sansonno","given":"D."},{"family":"Piccoli","given":"C."},{"family":"Tucci","given":"F.

  {"id":"DavidGoldberg1996","abstract":"Background: The pathophysiology of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia, which occurs, at lower heart rates than during physical stress, is not well understood. Methods and Results: The Psychophysiological Investigations of Myocardial Ischemia Study (PIMI) evaluated the physiological and neuroendocrine functioning in unmedicated patients with stable coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia. Hemodynamic and neurohormonal responses to bicycle exercise, public speaking, and the Stroop test were measured by radionuclide ventriculography, ECG, and blood pressure and catecholamine monitoring. With mental stress, there were increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance that were correlated with increases in plasma epinephrine. During exercise, systemic vascular resistance fell, and there was no relationship between the hemodynamic changes and epinephrine levels. The fall in ejection fraction was greater with mental stress than exercise. During mental stress, the changes in election fraction were inversely correlated with the changes in systemic vascular resistance. Evidence for myocardial ischemia was present in 92% of patients during bicycle exercise and in 58% of patients during mental stress. Greater increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine occurred with ischemia during exercise, and greater increases in systemic vascular resistance occurred with ischemia during mental stress. Conclusions: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with a significant increase in systemic vascular resistance and a relatively minor increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product compared with ischemia induced by exercise. These hemodynamic responses to mental stress can be mediated by the adrenal secretion of epinephrine. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved are important in the understanding of the etiology of myocardial ischemia and perhaps in the selection of appropriate anti-ischemic therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"David Goldberg","given":"A."},{"family":"Becker","given":"Lewis C."},{"family":"Bonsall","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jerome D."},{"family":"Ketterer","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Peter G."},{"family":"Krantz","given":"David S."},{"family":"Light","given":"Kathleen C."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Robert P."},{"family":"Noreuil","given":"Todd"},{"family":"Pepine","given":"Carl J."},{"family":"Raczynski","given":"James"},{"family":"Stone","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Dawn Strother","given":"R.

  {"id":"Davydov2007","abstract":"Background: Recent studies have shown that depressive disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective of this study was to gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. Methods: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. Results: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of effective baroreflex reactions (reflex gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. Conclusions: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"DeAnda2001","abstract":"Acute respiratory failure is caused by many factors and remains one of the most common reasons for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In all cases of acute respiratory failure, there is a shortage of surfactant at the alveolar level. This deficit of surfactant leads to an increase in alveolar surface tension that increases the retraction forces of the lung, leading to end-expiratory alveolar collapse, finally resulting in respiratory dysfunction, which includes hypoxemia, low lung compliance, increase of intrapulmonary shunts, low functional residual capacity, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The goal of the treatment and prevention of acute respiratory failure is therefore based on the following three main items: re-opening the collapsed alveolar units; preserving the active surfactant component in the remaining functional alveolar units, and preventing end-expiratory collapse. The following strategies can be used to prevent and/or treat acute respiratory failure: counterbalancing the retraction forces of the lung by applying sufficiently high external pressures; and/or decreasing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface by means of exogenous surfactant, and/or eliminating the air-liquid interface by filling the lung with perfluorocarbons. By applying these therapeutic strategies in routine clinical practice, we should achieve a reduction in the mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.

Methods In this randomized, single-blind clinical trial, we randomly assigned children with sickle cell anemia to receive regular blood transfusions (transfusion group) or standard care (observation group).

  {"id":"DeBeck2010a","abstract":"Previous research has suggested a relationship between low-frequency power of heart rate variability (HRV; LF in normalized units, LFnu) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). However, investigations have not systematically controlled for breathing, which can modulate both HRV and MSNA. Accordingly, the aims of this experiment were to investigate the possibility of parallel responses in MSNA and HRV (LFnu) to selected acute stressors and the effect of controlled breathing. After data were obtained at rest, 12 healthy males (28 ± 5 yr) performed isometric handgrip exercise (30% maximal voluntary contraction) and the cold pressor test in random order, and were then exposed to hypoxia (inspired fraction of O2 = 0.105) for 7 min, during randomly assigned spontaneous and controlled breathing conditions (20 breaths/min, constant tidal volume, isocapnic). MSNA was recorded from the peroneal nerve, whereas HRV was calculated from ECG. At rest, controlled breathing did not alter MSNA but decreased LFnu (P < 0.05 for all) relative to spontaneous breathing. MSNA increased in response to all stressors regardless of breathing. LFnu increased with exercise during both breathing conditions. During cold pressor, LFnu decreased when breathing was spontaneous, whereas in the controlled breathing condition, LFnu was unchanged from baseline. Hypoxia elicited increases in LFnu when breathing was controlled, but not during spontaneous breathing. The parallel changes observed during exercise and controlled breathing during hypoxia suggest that LFnu may be an indication of sympathetic outflow in select conditions. However, since MSNA and LFnu did not change in parallel with all stressors, a cautious approach to the use of LFnu as a marker of sympathetic activity is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"DeBeck","given":"Lindsay D."},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Stewart R."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Kelvin E."},{"family":"Stickland","given":"Michael K."}],"citation-key":"DeBeck2010a","container-title":"American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpregu.00246.2009","ISSN":"0363-6119","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"page":"R80-R91","publisher":"American Physiological Society","source":"journals.physiology.org (Atypon)","title":"Heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity response to acute stress: the effect of breathing","title-short":"Heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity response to acute stress","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00246.2009","volume":"299"},

  {"id":"Decloedt2020","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically relevant arrhythmia in horses, with a reported prevalence up to 2.5%. The pathophysiology has mainly been investigated in experimental animal models and human medicine, with limited studies in horses. Atrial fibrillation results from the interplay between electrical triggers and a susceptible substrate. Triggers consist of atrial premature depolarizations due to altered automaticity or triggered activity, or local (micro)reentry. The arrhythmia is promoted by atrial myocardial ion channel alterations, Ca2+ handling alterations, structural abnormalities, and autonomic nervous system imbalance. Predisposing factors include structural heart disease such as valvular regurgitation resulting in chronic atrial stretch, although many horses show so-called ‘lone AF’ or idiopathic AF in which no underlying cardiac abnormalities can be detected using routine diagnostic techniques. These horses may have underlying ion channel dysfunction or undiagnosed myocardial (micro)structural alterations. Atrial fibrillation itself results in electrical, contractile and structural remodelling, fostering AF maintenance. Electrical remodelling leads to shortening of the atrial effective refractory period, promoting reentry. Contractile remodelling consists of decreased myocardial contractility, while structural remodelling includes the development of interstitial fibrosis and atrial enlargement. Reverse remodelling occurs after cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but full recovery may take weeks to months depending on duration of AF. The clinical signs of AF depend on the aerobic demands during exercise, ventricular rhythm response and presence of underlying cardiac disease. In horses with so-called ‘lone AF’, clinical signs are usually absent at rest but during exercise poor performance, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory distress, weakness or rarely collapse may develop.","author":[{"family":"Decloedt","given":"Annelies"},{"family":"Van Steenkiste","given":"Glenn"},{"family":"Vera","given":"Lisse"},{"family":"Buhl","given":"Rikke"},{"family":"Loon","given":"Gunther","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Decloedt2020","container-title":"Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.105521","ISSN":"15322971","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-8","PMID":"32928494","title":"Atrial fibrillation in horses part 1: Pathophysiology","type":"article-journal","volume":"263"},

There are many ways that the dysregulation of the HPA axis can be assessed: by sampling diurnal basal secretion and/or in response to a stress task, pharmacological challenge, and awakening. Here, we focus on the association between cortisol awakening response (CAR), as one index of HPA axis function, and MDD, given that the nature of this association is particularly unclear. Indeed, in the following selective review, we attempt to reconcile sometimes-divergent evidence of the role of CAR in the pathway to depression. We first examine association of CAR with psychological factors that have been linked with increased vulnerability to develop depression. Then, we summarize the findings regarding the CAR profile in those with current depression, and evaluate evidence for the role of CAR following depression resolution and continued vulnerability. Finally, we showcase longitudinal studies showing the role of CAR in predicting depression onset and recurrence. Overall, the studies reveal an important, but complex, association between CAR and vulnerability to depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dedovic","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Ngiam","given":"Janice"}],"citation-key":"Dedovic2015","container-title":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","DOI":"10.2147/NDT.S62289","ISSN":"11782021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,14]]},"page":"1181-1189","publisher":"Dove Medical Press Ltd.","title":"The cortisol awakening response and major depression: Examining the evidence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25999722/","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"DeFerrari1995","abstract":"Background: The relation between early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) is still unclear. In the present study, we compared spatiotemporal changes in [Ca2+](i) related to EADs and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) induced by isoproterenol. Methods and Results: Isolated patch-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes, loaded with fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 AM), were paced at 0.1 to 2 Hz. Isoproterenol (100 nmol/L) caused alterations in both phase 2 and phase 4 of the action potential (AP), consistent with EADs and DADs, respectively. During EADs (n=16), similar to driven APs, increases in [Ca2+](i), occurred simultaneously throughout the cell, whereas during DADs (n=25), they originated in discrete cell sites and propagated as a wave. This difference was confirmed by analysis of eight EADs and DADs coupled to the same beat. Ca2+ transients linked to EADs reached a peak relative fluorescence level (expressed as percentage of the maximal level reached during the last stimulated beat) that was always higher than that reached during the DADs (77±3% versus 64±2%, P<.001). Spatial heterogeneity of Ca2+ transients was assessed by the maximal time interval between peaks monitored in different cell regions; this time lag was always greater during DADs than during EADs (290 versus 40 milliseconds, P=.006). Conclusions: The present study had two main findings. First, even very modest notches occurring during the plateau of the AP may be accompanied by a marked secondary increase in [Ca2+](i). Second, these Ca2+ transients occurring during EADs are synchronous throughout the cell and differ significantly from those observed under identical conditions during DADs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"De Ferrari","given":"Gaetano M."},{"family":"Viola","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"D'Amato","given":"Elvira"},{"family":"Antolini","given":"Renzo"},{"family":"Forti","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"DeFerrari1995","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.91.10.2510","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",5,15]]},"page":"2510-2515","PMID":"7743611","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","title":"Distinct patterns of calcium transients during early and delayed afterdepolarizations induced by isoproterenol in ventricular myocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.91.10.2510","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"DeFerrari2007","abstract":"Objectives: This study sought to assess the long-term predictive power of depressed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with preserved left ventricular function. Background: Risk stratification after MI is primarily performed by identifying patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) because of their greater mortality. Autonomic markers can help refining risk stratification. Depressed BRS (<3 ms/mm Hg) correlated with cardiovascular mortality in 1,284 post-MI patients during a 21-month follow-up in the multicenter ATRAMI (Autonomic Tone and Reflexes After Myocardial Infarction) study, but had no significant predictive power in patients with LVEF >35% or above age 65 years. Methods: Two hundred forty-four consecutive post-MI patients (age 59 ± 10 years) with LVEF >35% (average 54 ± 8%) were enrolled. They underwent a complete assessment, including BRS 4 weeks after MI. Results: During a 5-year mean follow-up, 14 (5.7%) patients died of cardiovascular causes. Multivariate analysis identified BRS (p = 0.0001), but not LVEF and age, as predictive of cardiovascular mortality. The relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) for depressed BRS was 11.4 (95% CI 3.3 to 39.0) for the overall population, 19.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 94.8) for patients ≤65 years, and 7.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 39.9) for patients above age 65. Conclusions: Even among the large number of low-risk post-MI patients with preserved left ventricular function, depressed BRS identifies, independently of age, a subgroup at long-term high risk for cardiovascular mortality in which more aggressive preventive strategies should be considered. © 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","author":[{"family":"De Ferrari","given":"Gaetano M."},{"family":"Sanzo","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Bertoletti","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Specchia","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Vanoli","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"DeFerrari2007","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2007.08.043","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"2285-2290","PMID":"18068036","title":"Baroreflex Sensitivity Predicts Long-Term Cardiovascular Mortality After Myocardial Infarction Even in Patients With Preserved Left Ventricular Function","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"DeGeus2019","abstract":"Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be “corrected” for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Geus","given":"Eco J.C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Gianaros","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Brindle","given":"Ryan C."},{"family":"Jennings","given":"J.

  {"id":"DeLago2021a","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter (AFL) are the most common clinically significant arrhythmias in older adults with an increasing disease burden due to an aging population. However, up-to-date trends in disease burden and regional variation remain unknown. In an observational study utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, age-standardized mortality and incidence rates for AF overall and for each state in the United States (US) from 1990 to 2017 were determined. All analyses were stratified by gender. The relative change in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) over the observation period were determined. Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression analysis. The mean ASIR per 100,000 population for men was 92 (+/-8) and for women was 62 (+/-5) in the US in 2017. The mean ASDR per 100,000 population for men was 5.8 (+/-0.3) and for women was 4.4 (+/-0.4). There were progressive increases in ASIR and ASDR in all but 1 state. The states with the greatest percentage change in incidence were New Hampshire (+13.5%) and Idaho (+16.0%) for men and women, respectively. The greatest change regarding mortality was seen in Mississippi (+26.3%) for men and Oregon (+53.8%) for women. In conclusion these findings provide updated evidence of increasing AF and/or AFL incidence and mortality on a national and regional level in the US, with women experiencing greater increases in incidence and mortality rates.

  {"id":"DeLauretis2011a","abstract":"The lung is frequently involved in connective tissue diseases (CTDs), although the frequency of lung manifestations varies according to the type of CTD. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are frequently seen in CTDs, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), accounting for a significant proportion of deaths. A large percentage of patients with CTD-associated ILD has limited and stable disease, not requiring treatment. However, a significant minority has severe and/or progressive disease, necessitating prompt initiation of treatment. CTD-ILD histological patterns include non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). NSIP is the most common pattern in all CTDs, except for RA, characterized by a higher frequency of UIP. ILD can present acutely or chronically, with acute presentations being more common in systemic lupus erythematosus and PM/DM. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressively worsening ILD characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. The characteristic histological pattern of IPF is UIP. Interestingly, a UIP pattern is associated with a significantly better survival in CTD-related disease compared to the idiopathic variety. Prognosis in IPF is dismal, with a median survival since diagnosis of 2-3 years. No treatment regimen has been shown to improve survival in IPF. By contrast, although there have been only two randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of immunosuppressive treatment in SSc-associated ILD, clinical experience suggests that immunosuppressive drugs in CTD-related ILDs are capable of benefiting a significant proportion of patients, particularly those with certain histological patterns of disease.

  {"id":"Denollet2010","abstract":"Anger is associated with cardiovascular stress reactivity; however, little is known about the effect of suppressed anger in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined whether patients with CAD who suppress their anger are at risk of adverse events. At baseline, 644 patients with CAD completed measures of anger, anger-in (reluctance to express anger), and Type D personality (tendency to experience distress and to be inhibited). The combination of high anger and anger-in scores was used to identify the presence of suppressed anger. The end points were major adverse cardiac events (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. After an average follow-up of 6.3 years (range 5 to 10), 126 patients (20%) had experienced a major adverse cardiac event, and 59 (9%) had experienced cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Anger (p = 0.009) and suppressed anger (p = 0.011) were associated with future major adverse cardiac events, but these associations were no longer significant after adjustment for clinical characteristics. However, suppressed anger remained associated with the more rigorous end point of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2.87, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 7.15, p = 0.024) after controlling for decreased systolic function, poor exercise tolerance, extent of CAD, and revascularization. Anger alone was not independently associated with this end point. Patients with a Type D personality had a fourfold rate of suppressed anger, and an adjustment for a Type D personality attenuated the observed association between suppressed anger and adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, patients with CAD who suppress their anger were at increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and this was accounted for by individual differences in Type D personality. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether racial differences in SCD incidence are attributable to differences in the prevalence of risk factors or rather to underlying susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias. Methods: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study is a prospective, population-based cohort of adults from across the United States. Associations between race and SCD defined per National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were assessed. Results: Among 22,507 participants (9,416 blacks and 13,091 whites) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease, there were 174 SCD events (67 whites and 107 blacks) over a median follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range: 4.6 to 7.3 years). The age-adjusted SCD incidence rate (per 1,000 person-years) was higher in blacks (1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.2) compared with whites (0.7; 95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.35; 95% CI: 1.74 to 3.20. The association of black race with SCD risk remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographics, comorbidities, behavioral measures of health, intervening cardiovascular events, and competing risks of non-SCD mortality (hazard ratio: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.77). Conclusions: In a large biracial population of adults without a history of cardiovascular disease, SCD rates were significantly higher in blacks as compared with whites. These racial differences were not fully explained by demographics, adverse socioeconomic measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and behavioral measures of health.","author":[{"family":"Deo","given":"Rajat"},{"family":"Safford","given":"Monika M."},{"family":"Khodneva","given":"Yulia A."},{"family":"Jannat-Khah","given":"Deanna P."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Todd M."},{"family":"Judd","given":"Suzanne E."},{"family":"McClellan","given":"William M."},{"family":"Rhodes","given":"J.

  {"id":"Desai2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND Concern persists that inflexible duty-hour rules in medical residency programs may adversely affect the training of physicians. METHODS We randomly assigned 63 internal medicine residency programs in the United States to be governed by standard duty-hour policies of the 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or by more flexible policies that did not specify limits on shift length or mandatory time off between shifts. Measures of educational experience included observations of the activities of interns (first-year residents), surveys of trainees (both interns and residents) and faculty, and intern examination scores. RESULTS There were no significant between-group differences in the mean percentages of time that interns spent in direct patient care and education nor in trainees’ perceptions of an appropriate balance between clinical demands and education (primary outcome for trainee satisfaction with education; response rate, 91%) or in the assessments by program directors and faculty of whether trainees’ workload exceeded their capacity (primary outcome for faculty satisfaction with education; response rate, 90%). Another survey of interns (response rate, 49%) revealed that those in flexible programs were more likely to report dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of training, including educational quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.73) and overall well-being (odds ratio, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.65). In contrast, directors of flexible programs were less likely to report dissatisfaction with multiple educational processes, including time for bedside teaching (response rate, 98%; odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.49). Average scores (percent correct answers) on in-training examinations were 68.9% in flexible programs and 69.4% in standard programs; the difference did not meet the noninferiority margin of 2 percentage points (difference, −0.43; 95% CI, −2.38 to 1.52; P=0.06 for noninferiority). CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in the proportion of time that medical interns spent on direct patient care and education between programs with standard duty-hour policies and programs with more flexible policies. Interns in flexible programs were less satisfied with their educational experience than were their peers in standard programs, but program directors were more satisfied.

  {"id":"DeSilva1989","abstract":"Sudden death is frequently of cardiac origin, and its most common electrophysiologic mechanism is ventricular fibrillation. The concept that sudden death in human beings is due to ventricular fibrillation was first proposed by MacWilliam exactly 100 years ago, well before the electrocardiogram was invented. To conduct his experimental work, MacWilliam devised methods that laid the foundations for modern cardiac research and that provided the first comprehensive approach to successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He recognized the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating both the mechanical and the electrical properties of the heart, and was the first to suggest that this effect had a role in the genesis of sudden death. On the centennial of his theory of sudden death, MacWilliam's concepts are reviewed in the context of the effect of Darwinian influence on British physiology. It is suggested that his theorem was based on both sound experimental data and comparative physiology, drawing on the new evolutionary principle of similar structure and function in the hearts of various species. MacWilliam's basic physiologic concepts have survived intact for a century, greatly influencing more than three generations of research and practice in clinical cardiology. © 1989.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Regis A.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"DeSilva1989","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/0735-1097(89)90041-7","ISBN":"0735-1097","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"page":"1843-1849","PMID":"2685082","title":"John MacWilliam, evolutionary biology and sudden cardiac death","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

As one alternative, restricted cubic spline (RCS) functions are powerful tools (i) to characterize a dose-response association between a continuous exposure and an outcome, (ii) to visually and/or statistically check the assumption of linearity of the association, and (iii) to minimize residual confounding when adjusting for a continuous exposure. Because their implementation with SAS® software is limited, we developed and present here an SAS macro that (i) creates an RCS function of continuous exposures, (ii) displays graphs showing the dose-response association with 95 per cent confidence interval between one main continuous exposure and an outcome when performing linear, logistic, or Cox models, as well as linear and logistic-generalized estimating equations, and (iii) provides statistical tests for overall and non-linear associations. We illustrate the SAS macro using the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to investigate adjusted dose-response associations (with different models) between calcium intake and bone mineral density (linear regression), folate intake and hyperhomocysteinemia (logistic regression), and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular mortality (Cox model).","author":[{"family":"Desquilbet","given":"Loic"},{"family":"Mariotti","given":"François"}],"citation-key":"Desquilbet2010","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.3841","ISBN":"1097-0258","ISSN":"02776715","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"1037-1057","PMID":"20087875","title":"Dose-response analyses using restricted cubic spline functions in public health research","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"Dewey2008","abstract":"Background: Although exercise-associated ventricular arrhythmias are frequently observed during exercise testing, their prognostic significance remains uncertain. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of exercise-associated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) during and after exercise testing. Methods: We studied 1847 heart failure-free patients who underwent clinical treadmill testing between March 13, 1997, and January 15, 2004, in the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the clinical and exercise test associations of exercise and recovery PVCs. Propensity score-adjusted Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of exercise-associated PVCs. Results: Of the 1847 subjects, 850 (46.0%) developed exercise PVCs (median rate, 0.43 per minute) and 620 (33.6%) had recovery PVCs (median rate, 0.60 per minute). Resting PVCs, age, and systolic blood pressure were key predictors of both exercise and recovery PVCs. Whereas exercise PVCs were related to the heart rate increase with exercise, recovery PVCs were related to coronary disease (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedure, or pathological Q waves on resting electrocardiogram) and ST-segment depression. During a 5.4-year mean follow-up, 161 subjects (8.7%) died, and 53 of these deaths (32.9%) were due to cardiovascular causes. Recovery PVCs, but not exercise PVCs, were associated with 71% to 96% greater propensity-adjusted mortality rates (hazard ratio, 1.96 [95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.91] for infrequent PVCs; hazard ratio, 1.71 [95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.73] for frequent PVCs compared with subjects without PVCs), and occurrence of recovery PVCs reclassified 33.2% of subjects with intermediate-risk Duke Treadmill Scores into higher-risk subgroups.

We reviewed the incidence, prevalence, and predictors of HF in AFL and vice versa, and the outcomes of treatment of AFL in HF. A systematic literature review of PubMed/Medline and EMBASE yielded 65 studies for inclusion and qualitative synthesis. No study described the incidence or prevalence of AFL in unselected patients with HF. Most cohorts enrolled patients with AF/AFL as interchangeable diagnoses, or highly selected patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of HF in AFL ranged from 6% to 56%. However, the phenotype of HF was never defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). No studies reported the predictors, phenotype, and prognostic implications of AFL in HF. There was significant variation in treatments studied, including the proportion that underwent ablation. When systolic dysfunction was tachycardia-mediated, catheter ablation demonstrated LVEF normalization in up to 88%, as well as reduced cardiovascular mortality. In summary, AFL and HF often coexist but are understudied, with no randomized trial data to inform care. Further research is warranted to define the epidemiology and establish optimal management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Diamant","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Jason G."},{"family":"Virani","given":"Sean A."},{"family":"Jhund","given":"Pardeep S."},{"family":"Petrie","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Nathaniel M."}],"citation-key":"Diamant2021","container-title":"ESC Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1002/ehf2.13526","ISSN":"2055-5822","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,10]]},"page":"4484-4496","title":"Heart failure and atrial flutter: a systematic review of current knowledge and practices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ehf2.13526","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"Diamond2013","abstract":"Published reports of randomized clinical trials tend to emphasize the statistical significance of the treatment effect (p values) rather than its magnitude (effect size), although the clinical importance of the evidence depends more on the latter than on the former. We, therefore, compared the standard measures of effect size (relative and absolute risk reduction) and nonstandard composites of these measures (the product of the relative and absolute risk reductions and information content) with conventional assessments of statistical significance for 100 trials published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The p values were reported for 100% of the trials, relative risk reductions for 89%, and absolute risk reductions for 39%. Only 35% of trials reported both standard measures, and none reported either of the nonstandard measures. The standard measures correlated weakly (unexplained variance 77%). In contrast, the nonstandard measures correlated highly (unexplained variance 1.3%) but correlated weakly with statistical significance (unexplained variance 83%). Consequently, 25% of the trial results were adjudged \"clinically unimportant\" despite being \"statistically significant.\" In conclusion, our results have shown that composite measures of effect size communicate the clinical importance of trial results better than do conventional assessments of risk reduction and statistical significance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"DiBiase2016","abstract":"Background - Whether catheter ablation (CA) is superior to amiodarone (AMIO) for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure is unknown. Methods and Results - This was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator, New York Heart Association II to III, and left ventricular ejection fraction <40% within the past 6 months were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo CA for AF (group 1, n=102) or receive AMIO (group 2, n=101). Recurrence of AF was the primary end point. All-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization were the secondary end points. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. At the end of follow-up, 71 (70%; 95% confidence interval, 60%-78%) patients in group 1 were recurrence free after an average of 1.4±0.6 procedures in comparison with 34 (34%; 95% confidence interval, 25%-44%) in group 2 (log-rank P<0.001). The success rate of CA in the different centers after a single procedure ranged from 29% to 61%. After adjusting for covariates in the multivariable model, AMIO therapy was found to be significantly more likely to fail (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.3; P<0.001) than CA. Over the 2-year follow-up, the unplanned hospitalization rate was (32 [31%] in group 1 and 58 [57%] in group 2; P<0.001), showing 45% relative risk reduction (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.76).

  {"id":"Dibner-Dunlap1992","abstract":"BACKGROUND Previous studies have documented abnormalities of arterial baroreflexes in animals and patients with congestive heart failure. This study determined whether cardiopulmonary reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity was abnormal in a canine model of low-output heart failure induced by rapid ventricular pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS We stimulated mechanoreceptors throughout the cardiopulmonary region by volume expansion and left atrial mechanoreceptors selectively by inflating small balloons at the junctions of the pulmonary veins and left atrium. Responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity and left atrial and systemic arterial pressures were recorded. In the control group, 15% volume expansion raised left atrial pressure 3.5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg and resulted in a 70 +/- 8% reduction in renal nerve activity. In the heart failure group, 15% volume expansion resulted in a 6.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg rise in left atrial pressure with only a 16 +/- 20% reduction in renal nerve activity (p < 0.01). When volume expansion was performed after pretreatment with hemorrhage to lower left atrial pressure to the normal range in the heart failure group, the markedly attenuated response in the heart failure group persisted. After vagotomy, volume expansion elicited no change in renal nerve activity. Inflation of the atrial balloons caused a 28 +/- 9% reduction in renal sympathetic nerve activity and a 13 +/- 4 mm Hg decrease in arterial pressure in the control group. Renal nerve activity (-5 +/- 3%) and mean arterial pressure (-1 +/- 1 mm Hg) did not change with balloon inflation in the heart failure group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that dogs with low-output heart failure exhibit marked attenuation of cardiopulmonary mechanoreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity. This attenuated response is mediated via cardiac vagal afferent fibers and is due to either abnormalities in cardiopulmonary baroreceptors or abnormalities in the central nervous system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dibner-Dunlap","given":"M E"},{"family":"Thames","given":"M D"}],"citation-key":"Dibner-Dunlap1992","container-title":"Circulation","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",12]]},"page":"1929-34","PMID":"1451264","title":"Control of sympathetic nerve activity by vagal mechanoreflexes is blunted in heart failure.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1451264","volume":"86"},
  {"id":"DiCarli2002","abstract":"Background: The role of cardiac sympathetic nerves in regulating coronary blood flow is controversial. We sought to determine the degree to which cardiac efferent sympathetic signals modulate coronary blood flow. The heterogeneous sympathetic reinnervation in transplanted hearts provides a model for studying the vasomotor responses to adrenergic stimulation in reinnervated and denervated coronary territories of the same heart. Methods: We studied 14 cardiac-transplant recipients who had normal coronary arteries and no evidence of rejection and 8 normal subjects. We used positron-emission tomography with [11C]hydroxyephedrine, an analogue of norepinephrine, to delineate sympathetic innervation. Using [13N]ammonia, we measured myocardial blood flow at rest, during adenosine-induced hyperemia, and in response to sympathetic stimulation induced by cold pressor testing. Results: In the transplant recipients, the uptake of [11C]hydroxyephedrine was greater in the territory served by the left anterior descending artery (mean±SE, 0.15±0.01) than in those served by the right coronary artery (0.07±0.01, P<0.001) or the circumflex artery (0.09±0.01, P<0.001). The basal flow was similar in all three regions, as was the percent increase in flow during hyperemia. However, the increase in flow in response to cold pressor testing was higher in the territory of the left anterior descending artery (46±10 percent) than in those of the right coronary artery (16±6 percent, P=0.01) or the circumflex artery (23±6 percent, P=0.06), although the changes in hemodynamics and levels of circulating catecholamines were similar. No such regional differences were observed in the normal subjects. Conclusions: Increases in coronary blood flow in response to sympathetic stimulation correlated with the regional norepinephrine content in the cardiac sympathetic-nerve terminals. These findings suggest that cardiac adrenergic signals play an important part in regulating myocardial blood flow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Carli","given":"Marcelo F."},{"family":"Tobes","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Mangner","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Arlene Barry"},{"family":"Muzik","given":"Otto"},{"family":"Chakroborty","given":"Pulak"},{"family":"Levine","given":"T.

  {"id":"Dickerson1998","abstract":"We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta. Sinus rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction (ventricular rate during atrial pacing), and left ventricular contractile force (LV dP/dt during right ventricular pacing) were measured in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs both before and during bilateral cervical vagus stimulation (20-30 V, 0.5 ms pulses, 15-20 Hz). Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg -1 i.v.). Control responses included sinus node bradycardia or arrest during spontaneous rhythm, high grade AV block or complete heart block, and a 30% decrease in contractility from 2118 ± 186 to 1526 ± 187 mm Hg s -1 (P < 0.05). Next, the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (0.3-1.0 ml of a 50 μg ml -1 solution) was injected into the CMV fat pad. Then vagal stimulation was repeated, which now produced a relatively small 5% (N.S., P > 0.05) decrease in contractility but still elicited the same degree of sinus bradycardia and AV block (N = 8, P < 0.05). Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19%. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation. Blockade of the CMV fat pad had no effect on vagally-mediated slowing of sinus rate or AV conduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickerson","given":"Linda W"},{"family":"Rodak","given":"David J"},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Terence J"},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Philip J"},{"family":"Massari","given":"V John"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"James C."},{"family":"Gillis","given":"Richard A"}],"citation-key":"Dickerson1998","container-title":"Journal of the Autonomic Nervous System","DOI":"10.1016/S0165-1838(98)00048-4","ISSN":"01651838","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"129-141","title":"Parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular fat pad on the dog heart selectively decrease ventricular contractility","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"Diekman2021","abstract":"Sudden cardiac arrest is a malfunction of the heart's electrical system, typically caused by ventricular arrhythmias, that can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) within minutes. Epidemiological studies have shown that SCD and ventricular arrhythmias are more likely to occur in the morning than in the evening, and laboratory studies indicate that these daily rhythms in adverse cardiovascular events are at least partially under the control of the endogenous circadian timekeeping system. However, the biophysical mechanisms linking molecular circadian clocks to cardiac arrhythmogenesis are not fully understood. Recent experiments have shown that L-type calcium channels exhibit circadian rhythms in both expression and function in guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes. We developed an electrophysiological model of these cells to simulate the effect of circadian variation in L-type calcium conductance. In our simulations, we found that there is a circadian pattern in the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are abnormal depolarizations during the repolarization phase of a cardiac action potential that can trigger fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically, the model produces EADs in the morning, but not at other times of day. We show that the model exhibits a codimension-2 Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation that serves as an organizing center for different types of EAD dynamics. We also simulated a two-dimensional spatial version of this model across a circadian cycle. We found that there is a circadian pattern in the breakup of spiral waves, which represents ventricular fibrillation in cardiac tissue. Specifically, the model produces spiral wave breakup in the morning, but not in the evening. Our computational study is the first, to our knowledge, to propose a link between circadian rhythms and EAD formation and suggests that the efficacy of drugs targeting EAD-mediated arrhythmias may depend on the time of day that they are administered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Diekman","given":"Casey O."},{"family":"Wei","given":"Ning"}],"citation-key":"Diekman2021","container-title":"Biophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.2264","ISSN":"15420086","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"319-333","PMID":"33285114","publisher":"The Biophysical Society","title":"Circadian Rhythms of Early Afterdepolarizations and Ventricular Arrhythmias in a Cardiomyocyte Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC7840416/","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"Diener2004","abstract":"Background Clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in patients with previous manifestations of atherothrombotic disease in the CAPRIE study and its benefit was amplified in some high-risk subgroups of patients. We aimed to assess whether addition of aspirin to clopidogrel could have a greater benefit than clopidogrel alone in prevention of vascular events with potentially higher bleeding risk. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare aspirin (75 mg/day) with placebo in 7599 high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and at least one additional vascular risk factor who were already receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day. Duration of treatment and follow-up was 18 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death, or rehospitalisation for acute ischaemia (including rehospitalisation for transient ischaemic attack, angina pectoris, or worsening of peripheral arterial disease). Analysis was by intention to treat, using logrank test and a Cox's proportional-hazards model. Findings 596 (15.7%) patients reached the primary endpoint in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel compared with 636 (16·7%) in the clopidogrel alone group (relative risk reduction 6.4%, [95% CI -4·6 to 16·3]; absolute risk reduction 1% [-0·6 to 2·7]). Life-threatening bleedings were higher in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone (96 [2·6%] vs 49 [1·3%]; absolute risk increase 1·3% [95% CI 0·6 to 1·9]). Major bleedings were also increased in the group receiving aspirin and clopidogrel but no difference was recorded in mortality. Interpretation Adding aspirin to clopidogrel in high-risk patients with recent ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack is associated with a non-significant difference in reducing major vascular events.

RESULTS Thirteen studies of inpatient internal medicine educational interventions were found that included an outcome assessment. All were single institution studies. The majority of these studies was of poor methodological quality and focused on specific content areas of internal medicine. None assessed the effectiveness or impact of internal medicine core inpatient experiences or curriculum.

Chronic daily headache with analgesic overuse: Epidemiology and impact on quality of life.Neurology.2004;62:1338-1342.Objective:To analyze the prevalence and demography of chronic daily headache (CDH) with analgesic overuse.Methods:A population of 9984 inhabitants aged 14 or older living in Santoña, Spain, was studied. The authors personally interviewed 4855 subjects, using a quota sampling approach. Those with headache for 10 days/month and some analgesic use were asked to fill in a diary over the course of 1 month. Then, subjects were classified into CDH with or without analgesic overuse subtypes. Quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) was also assessed in this second interview.Results:Headache for 10 days/month with analgesic consumption was reported by 332 subjects. Seven had secondary headache. Seventy-four (standardized prevalence 1.41%, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) fulfilled the criteria for CDH with analgesic overuse. Prevalence in women (2.6%, 2.0 to 3.3) was much higher than in men (0.19%, 0.006 to 0.52). Mean age was 56 years (range 19 to 82 years). As recalled by the subjects, the mean age at onset of CDH was 38 years (range 9 to 82 years), whereas the mean age at onset of CDH with frequent analgesic consumption was 45 years (range 19 to 80 years) and that of primary headache was 22 years (range 5 to 60 years). CDH subjects showed a significant decrease in each SF-36 health-related score as compared with healthy control subjects. Transformed migraine was diagnosed in 49 (prevalence 0.9%), chronic tension-type headache in 20 (0.4%), and new daily persistent headache in 5 (0.1%). Thirty-five percent of patients overused simple analgesics, 22% ergotics, 12.5% opioids, and 2.7% triptans; the remaining 27.8% were overusing different combinations.Conclusion:CDH with analgesic overuse is a common disorder in the general population, mainly in women in their fifties, in whom 5% meet its diagnostic criteria.Comment: This paper is important and also worrying. Spain and other Latin countries have historically allowed access to prescription only medicines, via pharmacies, without a physician's authorization (I write this partly based on my own anecdotal experience of purchasing them without authorization). This probably explains the high proportion of ergot-related-analgesic abuse and may suggest the same fate for the triptans when they become more widely available. It would be helpful for the IHS and AHS to provide a framework to ensure responsible access to these important prescription-only pharmaceuticals.-David S. Millson Schulte-Mattler WJ, Krack P, BoNTTH Study Group. Treatment of chronic tension-type headache with botulinum toxin A: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study.Pain. 2004;109:110-114.A beneficial effect of botulinum toxin on tension-type headache was reported in open-label studies but scientifically rigorous clinical studies are lacking. Therefore we conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Multiple pericranial muscles of 112 patients with chronic tension-type headache were treated either with 500 mouse units of botulinum toxin (Dysport(R)) or with placebo. The diagnoses were made strictly following the International Headache Society criteria. Co-existence of migraine was an exclusion criterion. Injections were made following a fixed scheme and not adjusted to the patient's symptoms. Patients kept a headache diary that was used to calculate the area under the headache curve of 6 weeks before and 12 weeks after the treatment as the main effect measure. Secondary effect measures were the number of days with headache, the number of days with intake of analgesics, the duration of the nocturnal sleep, and the Beck Depression Inventory score. There were no significant differences between the verum group and the placebo group in any of these variables. Seven patients of the verum group had transient weakness of the eyelids, the neck, or both, indicating that a higher dose tha used in this study does not seem sensible for the treatment of headache. The statistical power of the study was high enough to warrant the conclusion that there is no clinically significant effect of botulinum toxin A on chronic tension-type headache.Comment: It is important to ensure that this study, which demonstrates convincingly that botulinum toxin A was ineffective in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache, is given an equal'share of voice' as other studies suggesting that this treatment is effective. I wonder if the pharmaceutical news wires and public relations teams of'Botox' companies will be supporting this dissemination? I suspect not.-David S. MillsonI have become convinced of the effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxins in prophylaxis for many patients with episodic and chronic primary headaches, so I have reviewed this article carefully. It is an excellent study, well conducted and described. So, the unexpected results are not due to poor design. However, over the years the methods of administering botulinum neurotoxin have changed, increasing in number of sites injected, and decreasing in doses per injection. This parallels the theory that the toxin may work in pain by inhibiting sensory afferent neuropeptide release rather than by paralyzing muscles, and so a wider cachement area makes sense for injections. Also, many clinicians have switched to a combination of fixed site injections and a'follow the pain' approach to inhibit the'noisy' afferents. In this study, very few injections were given, compared to what is widely done now in the US. For example, the investigators gave only two injections per side in frontalis, temporalis, and occipitalis, and only one injection per side in occipitalis, splenius capitis, semispinalis, and, most surprising to me, trapezius. Most injectors in the United States give more injections in most of these sites, especially frontalis, temporalis, and trapezius. It is possible that the negative results are a result of this difference in methodology. Three large placebo controlled regulatory studies on botulinum neurotoxin type A for various primary headache types are close to completion in the US, so we should get some of the answers on efficacy and methodology in the next year.-Stewart J.

Analgesic overuse among subjects with headache, neck, and low-back pain.Neurology.2004;62:1540-1544.Objectives:To examine the prevalence of chronic headache (15 days/month) associated with analgesic overuse in relation to age and gender, and the association between analgesic overuse and chronic pain (i.e., migraine, non-migrainous headache, neck, and low-back pain).Methods:In the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 1995 to 1997 (HUNT-2), a total of 51,383 subjects responded to headache questions (Head-HUNT), of which 51,050 completed questions related to musculoskeletal symptoms and 49,064 questions regarding the use of analgesics.Results:The prevalence of chronic headache associated with analgesic use daily or almost daily for 1 month was 1% (1.3% for women and 0.7% for men) and for analgesic overuse duration of 3 months 0.9% (1.2% for women and 0.6% for men). Chronic headache was more than seven times more likely among those with analgesic overuse (1 month) than those without (odds ratio [OR]= 7.5, 95% CI: 6.6 to 8.5). Upon analysis of the different chronic pain subgroups separately, the association with analgesic overuse was strongest for chronic migraine (OR= 10.3, 95% CI: 8.1 to 13.0), intermediate for chronic nonmigrainous headache (OR= 6.2, 95% CI: 5.3 to 7.2), and weakest for chronic neck (OR= 2.6, 95% CI: 2.3 to 2.9) and chronic low-back (OR= 3.0, 95% CI: 2.7 to 3.3) pain. The association became stronger with increasing duration of analgesic use for all groups and was most evident among those with headache, especially those with migraine.Conclusions:Chronic headache associated with analgesic overuse is prevalent, and especially chronic migraine is more strongly associated with frequent intake of analgesics th n other common pain conditions like chronic neck and chronic low-back pain.","author":[{"family":"Dodick","given":"David W."}],"citation-key":"Dodick2006","container-title":"New England Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1056/NEJMcp042897","ISBN":"0017-8748","ISSN":"0028-4793","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"158-165","PMID":"21321350","title":"Chronic Daily Headache","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMcp042897","volume":"354"},

  {"id":"Dominguez-Rodriguez2010","abstract":"Diurnal rhythms influence cardiovascular physiology, i.e. heart rate and blood pressure, and they appear to also modulate the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events. Diurnal variations occur also at the molecular level including changes in gene expression in the heart and blood vessels. Moreover, the risk/benefit ratio of some therapeutic strategies and the concentration of circulating cardiovascular system biomarkers may also vary across the 24-hr light/dark cycle. Synchrony between external and internal diurnal rhythms and harmony among molecular rhythms within the cell are essential for normal organ biology. Diurnal variations in the responsiveness of the cardiovascular system to environmental stimuli are mediated by a complex interplay between extracellular (i.e. neurohumoral factors) and intracellular (i.e. specific genes that are differentially light/dark regulated) mechanisms. Neurohormones, which are particularly relevant to the cardiovascular system, such as melatonin, exhibit a diurnal variation and may play a role in the synchronization of molecular circadian clocks in the peripheral tissue and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moreover, mounting evidence reveals that the blood melatonin rhythm has a crucial role in several cardiovascular functions, including daily variations in blood pressure. Melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, chronobiotic and, possibly, epigenetic regulatory functions. This article reviews current knowledge related to the biological role of melatonin and its circadian rhythm in cardiovascular disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dominguez-Rodriguez","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Abreu-Gonzalez","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Sanchez-Sanchez","given":"Juan J."},{"family":"Kaski","given":"Juan C."},{"family":"Reiter","given":"Russel J."}],"citation-key":"Dominguez-Rodriguez2010","container-title":"Journal of Pineal Research","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00773.x","ISBN":"1600-079X (Electronic)0742-3098 (Linking)","ISSN":"1600079X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,1]]},"page":"14-22","PMID":"20536686","publisher":"Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)","title":"Melatonin and circadian biology in human cardiovascular disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00773.x","volume":"49"},
  {"id":"Dooley2018","abstract":"A wealth of evidence has implicated inflammation in the development of depression. Yet, the heterogeneous nature of depression has impeded efforts to understand, prevent, and treat the disease. The purpose of this integrative review is to summarize the connections between inflammation and established core features of depression that exhibit more homogeneity than the syndrome itself: exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward processing, decreased cognitive control, and somatic syndrome. For each core feature, we first provide a brief overview of its relevance to depression and neurobiological underpinnings, and then review evidence investigating a potential role of inflammation. We focus primarily on findings from experimental paradigms of exogenously-induced inflammation. We conclude that inflammation likely plays a role in exaggerated reactivity to negative information, altered reward reactivity, and somatic symptoms. There is less evidence supporting an effect of inflammation on cognitive control as assessed by standard neuropsychological measures. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and recommendationsfor how to test the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dooley","given":"Larissa N."},{"family":"Kuhlman","given":"Kate R."},{"family":"Robles","given":"Theodore F."},{"family":"Eisenberger","given":"Naomi I."},{"family":"Craske","given":"Michelle G."},{"family":"Bower","given":"Julienne E."}],"citation-key":"Dooley2018","container-title":"Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.09.006","ISSN":"18737528","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"page":"219-237","PMID":"30201219","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"The role of inflammation in core features of depression: Insights from paradigms using exogenously-induced inflammation","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC6192535/?report=abstract","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Drazner2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: We determined whether estimated hemodynamics from history and physical examination (H&P) reflect invasive measurements and predict outcomes in advanced heart failure (HF). The role of the H&P in medical decision making has declined in favor of diagnostic tests, perhaps due to lack of evidence for utility.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We compared H&P estimates of filling pressures and cardiac index with invasive measurements in 194 patients in the ESCAPE trial. H&P estimates were compared with 6-month outcomes in 388 patients enrolled in ESCAPE. Measured right atrial pressure (RAP) was <8 mm Hg in 82% of patients with RAP estimated from jugular veins as <8 mm Hg, and was >12 mm Hg in 70% of patients when estimated as >12 mm Hg. From the H&P, only estimated RAP > or =12 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; P<0.001) and orthopnea > or =2 pillows (OR 3.6; P<0.05) were associated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) > or =30 mm Hg. Estimated cardiac index did not reliably reflect measured cardiac index (P=0.09), but \"cold\" versus \"warm\" profile was associated with lower median measured cardiac index (1.75 vs. 2.0 L/min/m(2); P=0.004). In Cox regression analysis, discharge \"cold\" or \"wet\" profile conveyed a 50% increased risk of death or rehospitalization.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: In advanced HF, the presence of orthopnea and elevated jugular venous pressure are useful to detect elevated PCWP, and a global assessment of inadequate perfusion (\"cold\" profile) is useful to detect reduced cardiac index.

Little is known about the hierarchical order of authorship and its change over time. Objective. - To assess the change in number and profile of authors of original articles published over a 20-year period in BMJ. It was hypothesized that the number of authors increased over this 20-year period and that it was the senior scientists who benefited most. Design. - Comparative descriptive analysis of the number and academic rank of authors who published original articles in BMJ volumes 270 (1975), 280 (1980), 290 (1985), 300 (1990), and 310 (1995). Main Outcome Measures. - The specific academic rank, order, and number of authors for each original article. Eight categories of authorship were distinguished as follows: 1, professor; 2, department chairperson; 3, consultant; 4, senior registrar; 5, lecturer and/or registrar; 6, medical student; 7, house officer; and 8, miscellaneous. Results. - The number of original articles published per year decreased from 262 (1975) to 125 (1995). The mean number (SD) of authors per article increased steadily from 3.21 (SD, 1.89) (1975) to 4.46 (SD, 2.04) (1995). Most authors belonged to category 3, and its proportion varied from 24.7% (1975) to 22.6% (1995), while category 1 grew from 13.2% to 20.3%. Category 5 authorship dropped from 24.3% (1975) to 15.8% (1995). With regard to first authorship, category 1 more than doubled from 8.0% (1975) to 16.8% (1995) compared with category 5 whose proportion decreased from 34.0% to 24.8%. Most last authors were from category 1, 20.4% (1975), growing to 29.0% (1995). Conclusion. - Over the last 20 years the number of BMJ authors of original articles increased, mainly because of the rise of authorship among professors and department chairpersons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Drenth","given":"Joost P.H."}],"citation-key":"Drenth1998","container-title":"Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.280.3.219","ISSN":"00987484","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",7,15]]},"page":"219-221","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Multiple authorship.

  {"id":"Dudbridge2013","abstract":"Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow., Recently there has been much interest in combining multiple genetic markers into a single score for predicting disease risk. Even if many of the individual markers have no detected effect, the combined score could be a strong predictor of disease. This has allowed researchers to demonstrate that some diseases have a strong genetic basis, even if few actual genes have been identified, and it has also revealed a common genetic basis for distinct diseases. These analyses have so far been performed opportunistically, with mixed results. Here I derive formulae based on the heritability of disease and size of the study, allowing researchers to plan their analyses from a more informed position. I show that discouraging results in some previous studies were due to the low number of subjects studied, but a modest increase in study size would allow more successful analysis. However, I also show that, for genetics to become useful for predicting individual risk of disease, hundreds of thousands of subjects may be needed to estimate the gene effects. This is larger than most existing studies, but will become more common in the near future, so that gene scores will become more useful for predicting disease than has appeared to date.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dudbridge","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"Dudbridge2013","container-title":"PLoS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLoS Genet","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348","ISSN":"1553-7390","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,21]]},"page":"e1003348","PMCID":"PMC3605113","PMID":"23555274","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Power and Predictive Accuracy of Polygenic Risk Scores","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605113/","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Duffy2017","abstract":"Authorship is intended to convey information regarding credit and responsibility for manuscripts. However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and regarding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manuscript. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos, I found that: (1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; (2) the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; (3) 84% of papers published in 2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and (4) geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also carried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding authorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the \"senior\" author on a paper (i.e., the person who runs the research group in which most of the work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I suggest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author. I also suggest ways of deciding author order in cases where two senior authors contributed equally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Meghan A."}],"citation-key":"Duffy2017","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.3435","ISSN":"20457758","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"8876","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","title":"Last and corresponding authorship practices in ecology","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Dukes1984","abstract":"Selective adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have been used to analyse the effects of stimulation of individual types of adrenoceptor in various parts of the rabbit heart. The selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists used were St 587 and BHT 933 respectively, and the antagonists were prazosin (alpha 1) and WY 25309 (alpha 2). The selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists were atenolol and ICI 118551, respectively. Pirbuterol was a highly selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. The non-selective agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were also employed with various combinations of antagonists. Phenylephrine was found to stimulate beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors. Rimiterol was a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially selective for beta 2-adrenoceptors. In the sinus node beta 1-, but not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the fast phase of depolarization (Vmax). Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increased the slope of slow diastolic depolarization, accelerated repolarization and increased maximum diastolic potential. After blockade of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation caused bradycardia, due exclusively to delayed repolarization. alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation had no effect. In Purkinje cells and papillary muscle both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation accelerated repolarization. Stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors had no effect. Beta 1-, not beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation augmented peak contractions 3-5-fold, and greatly increased rate of development of tension. After beta-blockade alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation moderately increased peak contractions (up to 47%), but increased time-to-peak and duration of contractions. These patterns of adrenoceptor-mediated effects were unchanged in animals pre-treated with sufficient 6-hydroxydopamine to eliminate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results would be consistent with beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation increasing inward calcium current, and with stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors delaying its inactivation, rather than increasing its magnitude.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Dukes","given":"I D"},{"family":"Vaughan Williams","given":"E M"}],"citation-key":"Dukes1984","container-title":"The Journal of Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015436","ISSN":"14697793","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1984",10,1]]},"page":"523-546","PMID":"6149314","title":"Effects of selective alpha 1‐, alpha 2‐, beta 1‐and beta 2‐adrenoceptor stimulation on potentials and contractions in the rabbit heart.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6149314","volume":"355"},

  {"id":"Dungu2014","abstract":"Objectives This study was devised to describe the different cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) appearances in light chain amyloid (AL) and transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR). Background CMR is increasingly used to investigate patients with suspected amyloidosis. Global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has been reported as typical of AL amyloidosis, whereas different patterns have been noted in ATTR amyloidosis. Methods We performed de novo analyses on original DICOM magnetic resonance imaging in 46 patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis and 51 patients with ATTR type who had been referred to a specialist amyloidosis center between 2007 and 2012 after CMR. Histological examination was performed in all cases, with immunohistochemistry, to confirm systemic amyloidosis. Results Patients' median age was 68 ± 10 years, and 74% were male. Left ventricular mass was markedly increased in ATTR amyloidosis (228 g [202 to 267 g]) compared with AL type (167 g [137 to 191 g]) (p < 0.001). LGE was detected in all but 1 cardiac amyloidosis patient (AL type) and was substantially more extensive in ATTR compared with AL amyloidosis. Ninety percent of ATTR patients demonstrated transmural LGE compared with 37% of AL patients (p < 0.001). Right ventricular LGE was apparent in all ATTR patients but in only 33 AL patients (72%) (p < 0.001). Despite these findings, survival was significantly better in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis compared with AL type. We derived an LGE scoring system (Query Amyloid Late Enhancement) that independently differentiated ATTR from AL amyloidosis and, when incorporated into a logistic regression model with age and wall thickness, detected ATTR type with 87% sensitivity and 96% specificity. Conclusions Transmural patterns of LGE distinguished ATTR from AL cardiac amyloidosis with high accuracy in this real-world analysis of CMR. Precise diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is crucial given the role of chemotherapy in AL type and with novel therapies for ATTR type currently in development.","author":[{"family":"Dungu","given":"Jason N."},{"family":"Valencia","given":"Oswaldo"},{"family":"Pinney","given":"Jennifer H."},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Simon D J"},{"family":"Rowczenio","given":"Dorota"},{"family":"Gilbertson","given":"Janet A."},{"family":"Lachmann","given":"Helen J."},{"family":"Wechalekar","given":"Ashutosh"},{"family":"Gillmore","given":"Julian D."},{"family":"Whelan","given":"Carol J."},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Philip N."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Lisa J."}],"citation-key":"Dungu2014","container-title":"JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.08.015","ISSN":"1936878X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"133-142","PMID":"24412186","title":"CMR-based differentiation of AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Dunning2017","abstract":"Executive Summary The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Task Force on Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery provides this professional society perspective on resuscitation in patients who arrest after cardiac surgery. This document was created using a multimodal methodology for evidence generation and includes information from existing guidelines, from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, from our own structured literature reviews on issues particular to cardiac surgery, and from an international survey on resuscitation hosted by CTSNet. In gathering evidence for this consensus paper, searches were conducted using the MEDLINE keywords “cardiac surgery,” “resuscitation,” “guideline,” “thoracic surgery,” “cardiac arrest,” and “cardiac massage.” Weight was given to clinical studies in humans, although some case studies, mannequin simulations of potential protocols, and animal models were also considered. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method consisting of two rounds of voting until 75% agreement on appropriate wording and strength of the opinions was reached. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Critical Care was enlisted in this process to provide a wider variety of experiences and backgrounds in an effort to reinforce the opinions provided. We start with the premise that external massage is ineffective for an arrest due to tamponade or hypovolemia (bleeding), and therefore these subsets of patients will receive inadequate cerebral perfusion during cardiac arrest in the absence of resternotomy. Because these two situations are common causes for an arrest after cardiac surgery, the inability to provide effective external cardiopulmonary resuscitation highlights the importance of early emergency resternotomy within 5 minutes. In addition, because internal massage is more effective than external massage, it should be used preferentially if other quickly reversible causes are not found. We present a protocol for the cardiac arrest situation that includes the following recommendations: (1) successful treatment of a patient who arrests after cardiac surgery is a multidisciplinary activity with at least six key roles that should be allocated and rehearsed as a team on a regular basis; (2) patients who arrest with ventricular fibrillation should immediately receive three sequential attempts at defibrillation before external cardiac massage, and if this fails, emergency resternotomy should be performed; (3) patients with asystole or extreme bradycardia should undergo an attempt to pace if wires are available before external cardiac massage, then optionally external pacing followed by emergency resternotomy; and (4) pulseless electrical activity should receive prompt resternotomy after quickly reversible causes are excluded. Finally, we recommend that full doses of epinephrine should not be routinely given owing to the danger of extreme hypertension if a reversible cause is rapidly resolved. Protocols are given for excluding reversible airway and breathing complications, for left ventricular assist device emergencies, for the nonsternotomy patient, and for safe emergency resternotomy. We believe that all cardiac units should have accredited policies and protocols in place to specifically address the resuscitation of patients who arrest after cardiac surgery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunning","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Ley","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Strang","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Lizotte","given":"David E."},{"family":"Lamarche","given":"Yoan"},{"family":"Bartley","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Zellinger","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Katz","given":"Nevin"},{"family":"Arora","given":"Rakesh C"},{"family":"Dembitsky","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Aaron M"},{"family":"Lonchyna","given":"Vassy A"},{"family":"Haft","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Deakin","given":"Charles D."},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"John D"},{"family":"Firestone","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Bakaeen","given":"Faisal G"}],"citation-key":"Dunning2017","container-title":"Annals of Thoracic Surgery","DOI":"10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.10.033","ISSN":"15526259","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1005-1020","PMID":"28122680","title":"The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Expert Consensus for the Resuscitation of Patients Who Arrest After Cardiac Surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.10.033","volume":"103"},
  {"id":"Dupont1998","abstract":"This article presents methods for sample size and power calculations for studies involving linear regression. These approaches are applicable to clinical trials designed to detect a regression slope of a given magnitude or to studies that test whether the slopes or intercepts of two independent regression lines differ by a given amount. The investigator may either specify the values of the independent (x) variable(s) of the regression line(s) or determine them observationally when the study is performed. In the latter case, the investigator must estimate the standard deviation(s) of the independent variable(s). This study gives examples using this method for both experimental and observational study designs. Cohen's method of power calculations for multiple linear regression models is also discussed and contrasted with the methods of this study. We have posted a computer program to perform these and other sample size calculations on the Internet (see http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/prevmed/psintro.htm).

The development of knowledge and technology in the field of deep machine learning creates an opportunity to try and transfer human knowledge to the computer. In turn, this fact influences the development of systems for the automatic evaluation of the patient’s health based on data acquired from sensors. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a technique that enables visualizing the electrical activity of the heart in a noninvasive way, using electrodes placed on the surface of the skin. This signal carries a lot of information about the condition of heart muscle. The aim of this work is to create a system for semantic segmentation of the ECG signal. For this purpose, we used a database from Lobachevsky University available on Physionet, containing 200, 10-second, and 12-lead ECG signals with annotations, and applied one-dimensional U-Net with the addition of squeeze-excitation blocks.

  {"id":"Dwyer-Lindgren2017","abstract":"IMPORTANCE Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity. OBJECTIVE To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Annual county-level life tableswere constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. EXPOSURES County of residence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk. RESULTS Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95%uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95%UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27%of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74%of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dwyer-Lindgren","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Bertozzi-Villa","given":"Amelia"},{"family":"Stubbs","given":"Rebecca W"},{"family":"Morozoff","given":"Chloe"},{"family":"Mackenbach","given":"Johan P"},{"family":"Van Lenthe","given":"Frank J."},{"family":"Mokdad","given":"Ali H"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Christopher J.L."}],"citation-key":"Dwyer-Lindgren2017","container-title":"JAMA Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.0918","ISSN":"21686106","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1003-1011","PMID":"28492829","title":"Inequalities in life expectancy among US counties, 1980 to 2014: Temporal trends and key drivers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28492829","volume":"177"},

  {"id":"Eifling2011","abstract":"Electrical storm is an increasingly common and life-threatening syndrome that is defined by 3 or more sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or appropriate shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator within 24 hours. The clinical presentation can be dramatic. Electrical storm can manifest itself during acute myocardial infarction and in patients who have structural heart disease, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or an inherited arrhythmic syndrome. The presence or absence of structural heart disease and the electrocardiographic morphology of the presenting arrhythmia can provide important diagnostic clues into the mechanism of electrical storm. Electrical storm typically has a poor outcome.The effective management of electrical storm requires an understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms, therapeutic options, device programming, and indications for radiofrequency catheter ablation. Initial management involves determining and correcting the underlying ischemia, electrolyte imbalances, or other causative factors. Amiodarone and β-blockers, especially propranolol, effectively resolve arrhythmias in most patients. Nonpharmacologic treatment, including radiofrequency ablation, can control electrical storm in drug-refractory patients. Patients who have implantable cardioverter-defibrillators can present with multiple shocks and may require drug therapy and device reprogramming. After the acute phase of electrical storm, the treatment focus should shift toward maximizing heart-failure therapy, performing revascularization, and preventing subsequent ventricular arrhythmias. Herein, we present an organized approach for effectively evaluating and managing electrical storm.","author":[{"family":"Eifling","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Razavi","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Massumi","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"Eifling2011","container-title":"Texas Heart Institute journal / from the Texas Heart Institute of St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Texas Children's Hospital","ISBN":"1068-607X","ISSN":"1526-6702","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"111-21","PMID":"21494516","title":"The evaluation and management of electrical storm.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-79955117743&partnerID=tZOtx3y1%5Cnhttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3066819&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"Elizari2007","abstract":"The trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system and the concept of trifascicular block and hemiblock were described by Rosenbaum and his coworkers in 1968. Since then, anatomic, pathological, electrophysiological, and clinical studies have confirmed the original description and scarce advances have been developed on the subject. In the present study, we attempt to review and redefine reliable criteria for the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic diagnosis of left anterior and posterior hemiblock. One of the most important problems related to hemiblocks is that they may simulate or conceal the electrocardiographic signs of myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia and may mask or simulate ventricular hypertrophy. Illustrative examples of these associations are shown to help the interpretation of electrocardiograms. The incidence and prevalence of the hemiblocks is presented based on studies performed in hospital patients and general populations. One of the most common causes of hemiblocks is coronary artery disease, and there is a particularly frequent association between anteroseptal myocardial infarction and left anterior hemiblock. The second most important cause is arterial hypertension, followed by cardiomyopathies and Lev and Lenègre diseases. The hemiblocks may also occur in aortic heart disease and congenital cardiopathies. Left anterior hemiblock is more common in men and increases in frequency with advancing age. Evidence is presented regarding the relationship of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects, which may explain the finding of this and other conduction defects in young populations. Isolated left anterior hemiblock is a relatively frequent finding in subjects devoid of evidence of structural heart disease. Conversely, isolated left posterior hemiblock is a very rare finding; its prognostic significance is unknown and is commonly associated with right bundle-branch block. The most remarkable feature of this association is that the prognosis is much more serious with a great propensity to develop complete atrioventricular block and Adams-Stoke seizures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Elizari","given":"Marcelo V"},{"family":"Acunzo","given":"Rafael S"},{"family":"Ferreiro","given":"Marcela"}],"citation-key":"Elizari2007","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.637389","ISBN":"1524-4539 (Electronic)\\r0009-7322 (Linking)","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"1154-1163","PMID":"17339573","title":"Hemiblocks revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.circulationaha.org","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"Engel1989","abstract":"The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown. © 1989, Massachusetts Medical Society.

  {"id":"England2002","abstract":"Background There are two approaches to the treat- ment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both ap- proaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recom- mended. Methods We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in pa- tients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results A total of 4060 patients (mean [±SD] age, 69.7±9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 per- cent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P=0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normal- ized ratio was subtherapeutic. Conclusions Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advan- tage over the rate-control strategy, and there are po- tential advantages, such as a lower risk of adverse drug effects, with the rate-control strategy.

Antiarrhythmic drug therapy has experienced ups and downs during the last 30 years balancing high antiarrhythmic potential, toxic side effects and pro-arrhythmic potency.

  {"id":"Esteban2007","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of patients with sepsis according to location on a ward or in an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Prospective multicentered observational study. SETTING: Three academic hospitals in Madrid, Spain. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with sepsis admitted to participating hospitals from March 1 to June 30, 2003. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 15,852 patients >18 yrs of age were admitted. Sepsis was identified in 702 patients, giving an estimated cumulative incidence rate of 367 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year and a cumulative incidence rate among patients admitted to the hospital of 4.4%. Most septic patients had a community-acquired infection (71%). Severe sepsis developed in 199 patients (incidence rate, 104 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year), and 59 patients developed septic shock (incidence rate, 31 cases per 100,000 adult area residents per year). Most of the patients met the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock on the same day that they would have qualified for the septic status one step down the scale. In the other patients, the median time between sepsis and severe sepsis was 2 days (interquartile range, 2-5) and between severe sepsis and septic shock was 3 days (interquartile range, 1-4). Only 32% of severe sepsis patients received intensive care. The hospital mortality for all septic patients was 12.8%; for severe sepsis, 20.7%; and for septic shock, 45.7%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the high incidence of sepsis in a general population of patients admitted to hospital.

  {"id":"Fanaroff2015","abstract":"Importance: About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early, accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated. Objective: To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin. Study Selection Medline and Emcase: were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks. Results: The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95%CI, 2.0-4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95%CI, 1.5-4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95%CI, 1.8-3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95%CI, 2.1-8.6]) and any evidence of ischemia (specificity, 91%; LR, 3.6 [95%CI,1.6-5.7]). Both the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin (HEART) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores performed well in diagnosing ACS: LR, 13 (95%CI, 7.0-24) for the high-risk range of the HEART score (7-10) and LR, 6.8 (95%CI, 5.2-8.9) for the high-risk range of the TIMI score (5-7). The most useful for identifying patients less likely to have ACS were the low-risk range HEART score (0-3) (LR, 0.20 [95%CI, 0.13-0.30]), low-risk range TIMI score (0-1) (LR, 0.31 [95%CI, 0.23-0.43]), or low to intermediate risk designation by the Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand risk algorithm (LR, 0.24 [95%CI, 0.19-0.31]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with suspected ACS presenting to emergency departments, the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram alone did not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS. Instead, the HEART or TIMI risk scores, which incorporate the first cardiac troponin, provided more diagnostic information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Prior work has grouped these patterns together as “malignant,” without considering discrete subtypes. We describe the incidence of distinct patterns in the ictal-interictal spectrum at two centers and their association with outcomes. Methods We analyzed a retrospective cohort of comatose post-arrest patients admitted at two academic centers from January 2011 to October 2014. One center uses routine continuous EEG, the other acquires “spot” EEG at the treating physicians’ discretion. We reviewed all available EEG data and classified epileptiform patterns. We abstracted antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) administrations from the electronic medical record. We compared apparent incidence of each pattern between centers, and compared outcomes (awakening from coma, survival to discharge, discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2) across EEG patterns and number of AEDs administered. Results We included 818 patients. Routine continuous EEG was associated with a higher apparent incidence of polyspike burst-suppression (25% vs 13% P Conclusion We found high rates of epileptiform EEG findings, regardless of intensity of EEG monitoring.

  {"id":"Feldman2010","abstract":"Animal studies demonstrate that maternal touch and contact regulate infant stress, and handling during periods of maternal deprivation attenuates the stress response. To measure the effects of touch on infant stress reactivity during simulated maternal deprivation, 53 dyads were tested in two paradigms: still-face (SF) and still-face with maternal touch (SF+T). Maternal and infant cortisol levels were sampled at baseline, reactivity, and recovery and mother's and infant's cardiac vagal tone were measured during the free play, still-face, and reunion episodes of the procedure. Cortisol reactivity was higher among infants in the SF condition and while cortisol decreased at recovery for infants in the SF+T, it further increased for those in the SF. Vagal tone showed a greater suppression when SF was not accompanied by maternal touch. Touch synchrony during free play was associated with higher infant vagal tone, whereas touch myssynchrony - maternal tactile stimulation while the infant gaze averts - correlated with higher maternal and infant cortisol.

  {"id":"Fernandez1998","abstract":"Most variables of interest in laboratory medicine show predictable changes with several frequencies in the span of time investigated. The wave- form of such nonsinusoidal rhythms can be well described by the use of multiple components rhythmometry, a method that allows fitting a linear model with several cosine functions. The method, originally described for analysis of longitudinal time series, is here extended to allow analysis of hybrid data (time series sampled from a group of subjects, each represented by an individual series). Given k individual series, we can fit the same linear model with m different frequencies (harmonics or not from one fundamental period) to each series. This fit will provide estimations for 2m + 1 parameters, namely, the amplitude and acrophase of each component, as well as the rhythm-adjusted mean. Assuming that the set of parameters obtained for each individual is a random sample from a multivariate normal population, the corresponding population parameter estimates can be based on the means of estimates obtained from individuals in the sample. Their confidence intervals depend on the variability among individual parameter estimates. The variance- covariance matrix can then be estimated on the basis of the sample covariances. Confidence intervals for the rhythm-adjusted mean, as well as for the amplitude-acrophase pair, of each component can then be computed using the estimated covariance matrix. The p-values for testing the zero- amplitude assumption for each component, as well as for the global model, can finally be derived using those confidence intervals and the t and F distributions. The method, validated by a simulation study and illustrated by an example of modeling the circadian variation of heart rate, represents a new step in the development of statistical procedures in chronobiology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández","given":"Jose R"},{"family":"Hermida","given":"Ramón C"}],"citation-key":"Fernandez1998","container-title":"Chronobiology International","DOI":"10.3109/07420529808998683","ISSN":"07420528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"191-204","title":"Inferential statistical method for analysis of nonsinusoidal hybrid time series with unequidistant observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=icbi20","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Fernandez2004","abstract":"Population multiple components is a statistical tool useful for the analysis of time-dependent hybrid data. With a small number of parameters, it is possible to model and to predict the periodic behavior of a population. In this article, we propose two methods to compare among populations rhythmometric parameters obtained by multiple component analysis. The first is a parametric method based in the usual statistical techniques for comparison of mean vectors in multivariate normal populations. The method, through MANOVA analysis, allows comparison of the MESOR and amplitude-acrophase pair of each component among two or more populations. The second is a nonparametric method, based in bootstrap techniques, to compare parameters from two populations. This test allows one to compare the MESOR, the amplitude, and the acrophase of each fitted component, as well as the global amplitude, orthophase, and bathyphase estimated when all fitted components are harmonics of a fundamental period. The idea is to calculate a confidence interval for the difference of the parameters of interest. If this interval does not contain zero, it can be concluded that the parameters from the two models are different with high probability. An estimation of p-value for the corresponding test can also be calculated. Both methods are illustrated with an example, based on clinical data. The nonparametric test can also be applied to paired data, a special situation of great interest in practice. By the use of similar bootstrap techniques, we illustrate how to construct confidence intervals for any rhythmometric parameter estimated from population multiple components models, including the orthophase, bathyphase, and global amplitude. These tests for comparison of parameters among populations are a needed tool when modeling the nonsinusoidal rhythmic behavior of hybrid data by population multiple component analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández","given":"José Ramón"},{"family":"Mojón","given":"Artemio"},{"family":"Hermida","given":"Ramón C"}],"citation-key":"Fernandez2004","container-title":"Chronobiology International","DOI":"10.1081/CBI-120038630","ISSN":"07420528","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"469-484","PMID":"15332450","title":"Comparison of parameters from rhythmometric models with multiple components on hybrid data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=icbi20","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"Fernandez2009","abstract":"Most variables of clinical interest show predictable changes with different frequencies, mainly, but not exclusively, along the rest-activity cycle (circadian variation). Methods of linear least-squares estimation have been designed for the detection of periodic components in sparse and noisy time series (as they are usually present in clinical situations). They include the single and population-mean cosinor methods. In cases where more than one period is statistically significant over the span of time investigated, or when the waveform is non-sinusoidal, the use of multiple components analysis to fit a model consisting of several cosine functions (harmonics or not from a given fundamental period) is recommended. We describe these methods, from the characterization of the underlying models to the process of parameter estimation. As an application example, we describe the modelling of the circadian variation of blood pressure (BP). In most individuals, BP presents a morning increase, a small postprandial valley and a deeper descent during nocturnal rest. This pattern can be easily modelled by means of a model with periods of 24 and 12 hours.

  {"id":"Fernandez2015","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Fibroscan (FS) is a reliable noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease. However, there is no clear consensus with respect to the best FS cut-off values for use in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to compare the performance of FS and different biochemical markers in ALD patients; (b) to assess the best FS cut-off values for the prediction of fibrosis stage in our ALD population; and (c) to assess the influence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values on FS. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 135 consecutive and compensated ALD patients who underwent liver biopsy between November 2006 and March 2012 at Erasme Hospital. FS, Fibrotest, FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and Forns' scores were tested in all patients. RESULTS The diagnostic accuracy of FS was 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.95) for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.90-0.97) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. FS performed better than Fibrotest (0.81 and 0.88), APRI (0.65 and 0.75), Forns' (0.64 and 0.78), and FIB-4 (0.70 and 0.73). The optimal cut-off values of liver stiffness (LS) for predicting METAVIR fibrosis stage F≥3 and F4 disease were 10.3 and 18.0 kPa, respectively. AST showed a significant positive correlation with LS (r=0.24, P=0.001). However, exclusion of patients with AST more than 50 IU/l only lowered the LS cut-off for the diagnosis of F4 (14 vs. 18.0 kPa).

  {"id":"Finlay2016","abstract":"Background\nStriking temporal associations exist between ventricular arrhythmia and acute mental stress, for example, during natural disasters, or defibrillator shocks associated with stressful events. We hypothesized that electrophysiological changes in response to mental stress may be exaggerated at short coupling intervals and hence relevant to arrhythmia initiation.\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to determine the dynamic response in human electrophysiology during mental stress.\n\nMethods\nPatients with normal hearts and supraventricular tachycardia underwent electrophysiological studies avoiding sedation. Conditions of relaxation and stress were induced with standardized psychometric protocols (mental arithmetic and anger recall) during decremental S1S2 right ventricular (RV) pacing. Unipolar electrograms were acquired simultaneously from the RV endocardium, left ventricular (LV) endocardium (LV endo), and epicardium (LV epi), and activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) computed.\n\nResults\nTwelve patients ( 9 women; median age 34 years) were studied. During stress, effective refractory period (ERP) reduced from 228 ± 23 to 221 ± 21 ms (P < .001). ARIs reduced during mental stress (P < .001), with greater reductions in LV endocardium than in the epicardium or RV endocardium (LV endo −8 ms; LV epi −5 ms; RV endo −4 ms; P < .001). Mental stress depressed the entire electrical restitution curve, with minimal effect on slope. A substantial reduction in minimal ARIs on the restitution curve in LV endo occurred, commensurate with the reduction in ERP (LV endo ARI 195 ± 31 ms at rest to 182 ± 32 ms during mental stress; P < .001). Dispersion of repolarization increased sharply at coupling intervals approaching ERP during stress but not at rest.\n\nConclusion\nMental stress induces significant electrophysiological changes. The increase in dispersion of repolarization at short coupling intervals may be relevant to observed phenomena of arousal-associated arrhythmia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Finlay","given":"Malcolm C."},{"family":"Lambiase","given":"Pier D."},{"family":"Ben-Simon","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Taggart","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"Finlay2016","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","container-title-short":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2015.08.011","ISSN":"1547-5271","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"page":"175-182","PMCID":"PMC4703839","PMID":"26272521","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Effect of mental stress on dynamic electrophysiological properties of the endocardium and epicardium in humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4703839/","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"Finnerty2017","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Intravascular volume status is an important clinical consideration in the management of the critically ill. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has gained popularity as a non-invasive means of intravascular volume assessment via examination of the inferior vena cava (IVC). However, there are limited data comparing different acquisition techniques for IVC measurement by POCUS. The goal of this evaluation was to determine the reliability of three IVC acquisition techniques for volume assessment: sub-xiphoid transabdominal long axis (LA), transabdominal short axis (SA), and right lateral transabdominal coronal long axis (CLA) (aka \"rescue view\"). METHODS Volunteers were evaluated by three experienced emergency physician sonographers (EP). Gray scale (B-mode) and motion-mode (M-mode) diameters were measured and IVC collapsibility index (IVCCI) calculated for three anatomic views (LA, SA, CLA). For each IVC measurement, we calculated descriptive statistics, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and two-way univariate analyses of variance. RESULTS EPs evaluated 39 volunteers, yielding 351 total US measurements. Measurements of the three views had similar means (LA 1.9 ± 0.4cm; SA 1.9 ± 0.4cm; CLA 2.0 ± 0.5cm). For B-Mode, LA had the highest ICC (0.86, 95% CI [0.76-0.92]) while CLA had the poorest ICC (0.74, 95% CI [0.56-0.85]). ICCs for all M-mode IVCCI were low. Significant interaction effects between anatomical view and EP were observed for B-mode and M-mode measurements. Post-hoc analyses revealed difficulty in consistent view acquisition between EPs. CONCLUSION Inter-rater reliability of the IVC by EPs was highest for B-mode LA and poorest for all M-Mode IVC collapsibility indices (IVCCI). These results suggest that B-mode LA holds the most promise to deliver reliable measures of IVC diameter. Future studies may focus on validation in a clinical setting as well as comparison to a reference standard.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Finnerty","given":"Nathan M"},{"family":"Panchal","given":"Ashish R"},{"family":"Boulger","given":"Creagh"},{"family":"Vira","given":"Amar"},{"family":"Bischof","given":"Jason J"},{"family":"Amick","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Way","given":"David P"},{"family":"Bahner","given":"David P"}],"citation-key":"Finnerty2017","container-title":"Western Journal of Emergency Medicine","DOI":"10.5811/westjem.2016.12.32489","ISBN":"9780980200454","ISSN":"1936-900X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4]]},"page":"496-501","PMID":"28435502","publisher":"California Chapter of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (Cal/AAEM)","title":"Inferior Vena Cava Measurement with Ultrasound: What Is the Best View and Best Mode?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435502","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"Finocchiaro2020","abstract":"The term dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) defines a heterogeneous group of cardiac disorders, which are characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. In approximately one third of cases, DCM is familial with a genetic pathogenesis and various patterns of inheritance. Although the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been considered traditionally non-specific in DCM, the recently acquired knowledge of the genotype–phenotype correlations provides novel opportunities to identify patterns and abnormalities that may point toward specific DCM subtypes. A learned ECG interpretation in combination with an appropriate use of other ECG-based techniques including ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise tolerance test and imaging modalities, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, may allow the early identification of specific genetic or acquired forms of DCM. Furthermore, ECG abnormalities may reflect the severity of the disease and provide a useful tool in risk stratification and management. In the present review, we discuss the current role of the ECG in the diagnosis and management of DCM. We describe various clinical settings where the appropriate use and interpretation of the ECG can provide invaluable clues, contributing to the important role of this basic tool as cardiovascular medicine evolves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Finocchiaro","given":"Gherardo"},{"family":"Merlo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Nabeel"},{"family":"De Angelis","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Papadakis","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Olivotto","given":"Iacopo"},{"family":"Rapezzi","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Carr-White","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Mestroni","given":"Luisa"},{"family":"Sinagra","given":"Gianfranco"}],"citation-key":"Finocchiaro2020","container-title":"European Journal of Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1002/ejhf.1815","ISSN":"1879-0844","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 The Authors.

  {"id":"Fischer2016","abstract":"The circadian clock governs virtually all processes in the human body, including sleep-wake behaviour. Circadian misalignment describes the off-set between sleep-wake cycles and clock-regulated physiology. This strain is predominantly caused by external (societal) demands including shift work, early school start times and fast travels across time zones. Sleeping at the 'wrong' internal time can jeopardise health and safety, and we therefore need a good quantification of this phenomenon. Here, we propose a novel method to quantify the mistiming of sleep-wake rhythms and demonstrate its versatility in day workers and shift workers. Based on a single time series, our Composite Phase Deviation method unveils distinct, subject-and schedule-specific geometries (islands and pancakes') that illustrate how modern work times interfere with sleep. With increasing levels of circadian strain, the resulting shapes change systematically from small, connected forms to large and fragmented patterns. Our method shows good congruence with published measures of circadian misalignment (i.e., Inter-daily Stability and Behavioural Entrainment'), but offers added value as to its requirements, e.g., being computable for sleep logs and questionnaires. Composite Phase Deviations will help to understand the mechanisms that link living against the clock' with health and disease on an individual basis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Dorothee"},{"family":"Vetter","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Roenneberg","given":"Till"}],"citation-key":"Fischer2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep38601","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,8]]},"page":"1-10","PMID":"27929109","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"A novel method to visualise and quantify circadian misalignment","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

We aimed to establish birth weight-based benchmarks for in-hospital mortality in neonates with NEC.; Methods: Five hundred eleven centers belonging to the Vermont Oxford Network prospectively evaluated 71,808 neonates with birth weight of 501 to 1500 g between January 2005 and December 2006. The primary outcome variable was in-hospital mortality.; Results: Birth weight was divided into 4 categories by 250-g increments. The NEC risk (P < .001) and mortality (P < .001) decreased with higher birth weight category. Necrotizing enterocolitis was associated with a significant odds ratio for death for each category (P < .001). Across groups, the odds ratio for NEC mortality increased with higher birth weight category (category 1 = 1.6 vs category 4 = 9.9; P < .001).; Conclusion: The in-hospital mortality rate of neonates with NEC remains high and is significantly related to birth weight category. Although the risk and absolute mortality of NEC decrease with higher birth weight, the odds ratios indicate that NEC has a relatively greater impact upon mortality at higher birth weight.

  {"id":"Follath2002","abstract":"Background: Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitiser, improves myocardial contractility without causing an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. We compared the effects of levosimendan and dobutamine on haemodynamic performance and clinical outcome in patients with low-output heart failure. Methods: Patients were recruited into a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial. Under continuous haemodynamic monitoring, an initial loading dose of levosimendan of 24 μg/kg was infused over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 μgkg-1 min-1 for 24 h. Dobutamine was infused for 24 h at an initial dose of 5 μg kg-1 min-1 without a loading dose. The infusion rate was doubled if the response was inadequate at 2h. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with haemodynamic improvement (defined as an increase of 30% or more in cardiac output and a decrease of 25% or more in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure) at 24 h. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings: 103 patients were assigned levosimendan and 100 dobutamine. The primary haemodynamic endpoint was achieved in 29 (28%) levosimendan-group patients and 15 (15%) in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio 1.9 [95% CI 1.1-3.3]; p=0.022). At 180 days, 27 (26%) levosimendan-group patients had died, compared with 38 (38%) in the dobutamine group (0.57 [0.34-0.95]; p=0.029). Interpretation: In patients with severe, low-output heart failure, levosimendan improved haemodynamic performance more effectively than dobutamine. This benefit was accompanied by lower mortality in the levosimendan group than in the dobutamine group for up to 180 days.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Follath","given":"F."},{"family":"Cleland","given":"J.

  {"id":"Fonkoue2020","abstract":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with a greater risk of incident hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Inflammation, impaired baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) decreased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and overactive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity are suggested as contributing mechanisms. Increasing severity of PTSD symptoms has been linked to greater cardiovascular risk; however, the impact of PTSD symptom severity on inflammation and autonomic control of blood pressure has not yet been explored. We hypothesized that increasing PTSD symptom severity is linked to higher inflammation, greater SNS activity, lower PNS reactivity and impaired BRS. Seventy Veterans participated in this study: 28 with severe PTSD ((Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) > 60; S-PTSD), 16 with moderate PTSD (CAPS ≥ 45 ≤ 60; M-PTSD) and 26 Controls (CAPS < 45; NO-PTSD). We recorded continuous blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) via EKG, heart rate variability (HRV) markers reflecting PNS and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) at rest, during arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) testing via the modified Oxford technique, and during 3 min of mental stress via mental arithmetic. Blood samples were analyzed for 12 biomarkers of systemic and vascular inflammation. While BP was comparable between severity groups, HR tended to be higher (p = 0.055) in S-PTSD (76 ± 2 beats/min) than in Controls (67 ± 2 beats/min) but comparable to M-PTSD (70 ± 3 beats/min). There were no differences in resting HRV and MSNA between groups; however, cardiovagal BRS was blunted (p = 0.021) in S-PTSD (10 ± 1 ms/mmHg) compared to controls (16 ± 3 ms/mmHg) but comparable to M-PTSD (12 ± 2 ms/mmHg). Veterans in the S-PTSD group had a higher (p < 0.001) combined inflammatory score compared to both M-PTSD and NO-PTSD. Likewise, while mental stress induced similar SNS and cardiovascular responses between the groups, there was a greater reduction in HRV in S-PTSD compared to both M-PTSD and NO-PTSD. In summary, individuals with severe PTSD symptoms have higher inflammation, greater impairment of BRS, a trend towards higher resting HR and exaggerated PNS withdrawal at the onset of mental stress that may contribute to cardiovascular risk in severe PTSD.","author":[{"family":"Fonkoue","given":"Ida T."},{"family":"Marvar","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Norrholm","given":"Seth"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yunxiao"},{"family":"Kankam","given":"Melanie L."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Toure N."},{"family":"Vemulapalli","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Rothbaum","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Ford1998","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that depression is an independent predictor of poor outcome after the onset of clinical coronary artery disease. There are few data concerning depression as a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Johns Hopkins Precursors Study is a prospective, observational study of 1190 male medical students who were enrolled between 1948 and 1964 and who continued to be followed up. In medical school and through the follow-up period, information was collected on family history, health behaviors, and clinical depression. Cardiovascular disease end points have been assessed with reviews of annual questionnaires, National Death Index searches, medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of clinical depression in the medical students at 40 years of follow-up was 12%. Men who developed clinical depression drank more coffee than those who did not but did not differ in terms of baseline blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, smoking status, physical activity, obesity, or family history of coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the men who reported clinical depression were at significantly greater risk for subsequent coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.63) and myocardial infarction (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11-4.06). The increased risk associated with clinical depression was present even for myocardial infarctions occurring 10 years after the onset of the first depressive episode (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0). CONCLUSION: Clinical depression appears to be an independent risk factor for incident coronary artery disease for several decades after the onset of the clinical depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"Daniel E."},{"family":"Mead","given":"Lucy A."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Patricia P."},{"family":"Cooper-Patrick","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nae Yuh"},{"family":"Klag","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"Ford1998","container-title":"Archives of Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/archinte.158.13.1422","ISBN":"0003-9926","ISSN":"00039926","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",7,13]]},"page":"1422-1426","PMID":"9665350","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Depression is a risk factor for coronary artery disease in men: The precursors study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archinte.158.13.1422","volume":"158"},

  {"id":"Fortin2018","abstract":"Background: Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (ACS) (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion programme to prevent SCD complications.Objectives: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.Methods: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.Main results: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews, 10 of which had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention (five reported RCTs with other interventions; and five contained no studies). Five of the 15 reviews included participants randomised to RBC transfusion, but in one of these reviews only 10 participants were randomised with no usable data. Four reviews (nine trials with 1502 participants) reported data comparing short- or long-term RBC transfusions versus standard care, disease-modifying agents, a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy and long-term RBC transfusions versus transfusions to treat complications. All reviews were of high quality according to AMSTAR quality assessment, however, the quality of the included trials was highly variable across outcomes. Trials were downgraded according to GRADE methodology for risk of bias, indirectness (most trials were conducted in children with HbSS), and imprecision (outcomes had wide confidence intervals).In all four reviews and all comparisons there was little or no difference in the risk of death (very low-quality evidence). There were either no deaths or death was a rare event.Short-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (one review: two trials, 434 participants, GRADE very low- to low-quality evidence) In people undergoing low- to medium-risk surgery, RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in people with African haplotypes compared to standard care (low-quality evidence), but there was little or no difference in people with the Arabic haplotype (very-low quality evidence). There was also little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus standard care (two reviews: three trials, 405 participants, very low- to moderate-quality evidence) In children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities or silent cerebral infarct (SCI)), long-term RBC transfusions probably decrease the risk of stroke (moderate-quality evidence) and may decrease the risk of ACS and painful crisis compared to standard care (low-quality evidence). Long-term RBC transfusions may also decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities (low-quality evidence), but there may be little or no difference in the risk of SCI in children with normal TCD velocities and previous SCI (low-quality evidence).In children and adolescents already receiving long-term RBC transfusions for preventing stroke, in comparison to standard care, continuing long-term RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of SCI (low-quality evidence) but we do not know whether there is a difference in the risk of stroke (very-low quality evidence). In children with normal TCD velocities and SCI there was little or no diff rence in the risk of alloimmunisation or transfusion reactions, but RBC transfusions may increase the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Long-term RBC transfusion versus RBC transfusion to treat complications (one review: one trial, 72 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) In pregnant women, long-term RBC transfusions may decrease the risk of painful crisis compared to transfusion for complications (low-quality evidence); but there may be little or no difference in the risk of other SCD-related complications or transfusion reactions (very-low quality evidence).RBC transfusion versus disease-modifying agents (hydroxyurea) (two reviews: two trials; 254 participants, very low- to low-quality evidence) For primary prevention of stroke in children, with abnormal TCD and no severe vasculopathy on magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA), who have received at least one year of RBC transfusions, we do not know whether there is a difference between RBC transfusion and disease-modifying agents in the risk of stroke; SCI; ACS; or painful crisis (very-low quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Similarly, for secondary prevention of stroke in children and adolescents, we do not know whether there is a difference between these interventions in the risk of stroke; SCI; or ACS (very-low quality evidence); but hydroxyurea with phlebotomy may increase the risk of painful crisis and global SCD serious adverse events compared to RBC transfusion (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in the risk of iron overload (low-quality evidence).Restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategy (one review: one trial; 230 participants, very low-quality evidence) In people undergoing cholecystectomy, there was little or no difference between strategies in the risk of SCD-related or transfusion-related complications (very-low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: This overview provides support from two high-quality Cochrane Reviews for the use of RBC transfusions in preventing stroke in children and adolescents at high risk of stroke (abnormal TCDs or SCI) and evidence that it may decrease the risk of SCI in children with abnormal TCD velocities. In addition RBC transfusions may reduce the risk of ACS and painful crisis in this population.This overview highlights the lack of high-quality evidence in adults with SCD and the number of reviews that have no evidence for the use of RBC transfusions across a spectrum of SCD complications. Also of concern is the variable and often incomplete reporting of patient-relevant outcomes in the included trials such as SCD-related serious adverse events and quality of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortin","given":"Patricia M"},{"family":"Hopewell","given":"Sally"},{"family":"Estcourt","given":"Lise J"}],"citation-key":"Fortin2018","container-title":"Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD012082.pub2","ISSN":"1469493X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"page":"CD012082","PMID":"30067867","title":"Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: An overview of Cochrane reviews","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067867","volume":"2018"},
  {"id":"Foy2018","abstract":"Prospective cohort studies involving older adults report an association of obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. To assess this relation, we performed a longitudinal cohort study from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2013, using a national claims database that tracks all inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy claims data. The primary end point of new-onset atrial fibrillation was compared between obese and nonobese cohorts. We used logistic regression to determine the strength of association between obesity and new-onset atrial fibrillation controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes. Overall, 67,278 subjects were included in the cohort, divided evenly between those with and without a diagnosis of obesity. Obese subjects were significantly more likely to have hypertension (29.5% vs 14.6%) and diabetes (12.7% vs 5.2%) at study onset. Over 8 years of follow-up, we recorded a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in 1,511 (2.2%) subjects. Obesity was strongly associated with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, and diabetes (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 1.6). In conclusion, this information contributes to the growing evidence supporting the causal relation between obesity and atrial fibrillation, and emphasizes the need of addressing obesity as part of our therapeutic strategy to prevent atrial fibrillation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Foy","given":"Andrew J"},{"family":"Mandrola","given":"John"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guodong"},{"family":"Naccarelli","given":"Gerald V"}],"citation-key":"Foy2018","container-title":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019","ISSN":"18791913","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1072-1075","PMID":"29501206","title":"Relation of Obesity to New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter in Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.01.019","volume":"121"},

  {"id":"Franzoso2016","abstract":"Starting from the late embryonic development, the sympathetic nervous system extensively innervates the heart and modulates its activity during the entire lifespan. The distribution of myocardial sympathetic processes is finely regulated by the secretion of limiting amounts of pro-survival neurotrophic factors by cardiac cells. Norepinephrine release by the neurons rapidly modulates myocardial electrophysiology, and increases the rate and force of cardiomyocyte contractions. Sympathetic processes establish direct interaction with cardiomyocytes, characterized by the presence of neurotransmitter vesicles and reduced cell-cell distance. Whether such contacts have a functional role in both neurotrophin- and catecholamine-dependent communication between the two cell types, is poorly understood. In this review we will address the effects of the sympathetic neuron activity on the myocardium and the hypothesis that the direct neuro-cardiac contact might have a key role both in norepinephrine and neurotrophin mediated signaling.

Design: Prospective, counterbalanced experimental design. Setting: Laboratory study conducted under controlled conditions at three academic medical centers. Participants: Seventy-two senior medical students, 72 senior medical residents, and 72 faculty internists. Intervention: We created highly detailed, 2-to 4-page synopses of 36 diagnostically challenging medical cases, each with a definitive correct diagnosis. Subjects generated a differential diagnosis for each of 9 assigned cases, and indicated their level of confidence in each diagnosis. Measurements And Main Results: A differential was considered \"correct\" if the clinically true diagnosis was listed in that subject's hypothesis list. To assess confidence, subjects rated the likelihood that they would, at the time they generated the differential, seek assistance in reaching a diagnosis. Subjects' confidence and correctness were \"mildly\" aligned (kappa=.314 for all subjects, .285 for faculty, .227 for residents, and .349 for students). Residents were overconfident in 41% of cases where their confidence and correctness were not aligned, whereas faculty were overconfident in 36% of such cases and students in 25%.

  {"id":"Fu2022","abstract":"The mouse is a useful preclinical species for evaluating disease etiology due to the availability of a wide variety of genetically modified strains and the ability to perform disease-modifying manipulations. In order to establish an atrial filtration (AF) model in our laboratory, we profiled several commonly used murine AF models. We initially evaluated a pharmacological model of acute carbachol (CCh) treatment plus atrial burst pacing in C57BL/6 mice. In an effort to observe micro-reentrant circuits indicative of authentic AF, we employed optical mapping imaging in isolated mouse hearts. While CCh reduced atrial refractoriness and increased atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability, the left atrial (LA) excitation patterns were rather regular without reentrant circuits or wavelets. Therefore, the atrial tachyarrhythmia resembled high frequency atrial flutter, not typical AF per se. We next examined both a chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion model and the surgical model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC), which have both been reported to induce atrial and ventricular structural changes that serve as a substrates for micro-reentrant AF. Although we observed some extent of atrial remodeling such as fibrosis or enlarged LA diameter, burst pacing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia vulnerability did not differ from control mice in either model. This again suggested that an AF-like pathophysiology is difficult to demonstrate in the mouse. To continue searching for a valid murine AF model, we studied mice with a cardiac-specific deficiency (KO) in liver kinase B1 (Cardiac-LKB1), which has been reported to exhibit spontaneous AF. Indeed, the electrocardiograms (ECG) of conscious Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice exhibited no P waves and had irregular RR intervals, which are characteristics of AF. Histological evaluation of Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice revealed dilated and fibrotic atria, again consistent with AF. However, atrial electrograms and optical mapping revealed that electrical activity was limited to the sino-atrial node area with no electrical conduction into the atrial myocardium beyond. Thus, Cardiac-LKB1 KO mice have severe atrial myopathy or atrial standstill, but not AF. In summary, the atrial tachyarrhythmias we observed in the four murine models were distinct from typical human AF, which often exhibits micro- or macro-reentrant atrial circuits. Our results suggest that the four murine AF models we examined may not reflect human AF well, and raise a cautionary note for use of those murine models to study AF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Fumin"},{"family":"Pietropaolo","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Pandit","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weiyan"},{"family":"Tarnavski","given":"Oleg"},{"family":"Shetty","given":"Suraj S."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Lussier","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Murakami","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Grewal","given":"Prabhjit K."},{"family":"Deyneko","given":"Galina"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Gordon M."},{"family":"Taggart","given":"Andrew K.P."},{"family":"Waters","given":"M.

  {"id":"Fukuda2015","abstract":"Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fukuda","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Kanazawa","given":"Hideaki"},{"family":"Aizawa","given":"Yoshiyasu"},{"family":"Ardell","given":"Jeffrey L."},{"family":"Shivkumar","given":"Kalyanam"}],"citation-key":"Fukuda2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304679","ISBN":"1875-6557 (Electronic)\\r1573-403X (Linking)","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"2005-2019","PMID":"26044253","title":"Cardiac Innervation and Sudden Cardiac Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304679","volume":"116"},

Positive feedback pressor sympathetic reflexes can be obtained with physiological distensions of the descending thoracic aorta in conscious dogs with all nerves intact in absence of any pain reaction. These excitatory reflexes interact with supraspinal regulatory mechanisms, inhibitory in nature. A massive excitation of cardiac sympathetic afferents, produced by intracoronary injections of bradykinin, also elicits a pressor reflex, without pain reactions. In the absence of anesthesia and recent surgery, the cardiovascular excitatory reflexes, subserved by sympathetic afferent fibers, can easily prevail.

Because of the impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines). ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated. Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC and ERS to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management (including diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation) of a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy and approved by the ERS. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. Estimates of expected health outcomes for larger populations were included, where data exist. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and …","author":[{"family":"Galiè","given":"Nazzareno"},{"family":"Humbert","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Vachiery","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Torbicki","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Simonneau","given":"Gérald"},{"family":"Peacock","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Vonk Noordegraaf","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Beghetti","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Ghofrani","given":"Ardeschir"},{"family":"Gomez Sanchez","given":"Miguel Angel"},{"family":"Hansmann","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Klepetko","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Lancellotti","given":"Patrizio"},{"family":"Matucci","given":"Marco"},{"family":"McDonagh","given":"Theresa"},{"family":"Pierard","given":"Luc A."},{"family":"Trindade","given":"Pedro T."},{"family":"Zompatori","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Hoeper","given":"Marius"}],"citation-key":"Galie2016","container-title":"European Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehv317","ISBN":"1522-9645","ISSN":"0195-668X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"67-119","PMID":"26320113","title":"2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehv317","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"Garcia-Lopez2020","abstract":"The jugular venous pulse (JVP) is the reference physiological signal used to detect right atrial and central venous pressure (CVP) abnormalities in cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) diagnosis. Invasive central venous line catheterization has always been the gold standard method to extract it reliably. However, due to all the risks it entails, novel non-invasive approaches, exploiting distance cameras and lasers, have recently arisen to measure the JVP at the external and internal jugular veins. These remote options however, constraint patients to very specific body positions in front of the imaging system, making it inadequate for long term monitoring. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) can be an alternative for extracting the JVP from the anterior jugular veins, in a contact manner. Neck JVP-PPG signals were recorded from 20 healthy participants, together with reference ECG and arterial finger PPG signals for validation. B-mode ultrasound imaging of the internal jugular vein also proved the validity of the proposed method. The results show that is possible to identify the characteristic a, c, v pressure waves in the novel signals, and confirm their cardiac-cycle timings in consistency with established cardiac physiology. Wavelet coherence values (close to 1 and phase shifts of ±180°) corroborated that neck contact JVP-PPG pulses were negatively correlated with arterial finger PPG. Average JVP waveforms for each subject showed typical JVP pulses contours except for the singularity of an unknown \"u\" wave occurring after the c wave, in half of the cohort. This work is of great significance for the future of CVDs diagnosis, as it has the potential to reduce the risks associated with conventional catheterization and enable continuous non-invasive point-of-care monitoring of CVP, without restricting patients to limited postures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"García-López","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Villegas","given":"Esther"}],"citation-key":"Garcia-Lopez2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-60317-7","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,26]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"3466","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Extracting the Jugular Venous Pulse from Anterior Neck Contact Photoplethysmography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60317-7","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Gatell2008a","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are an essential component of therapy for patients with acute decompensated heart failure, but there are few prospective data to guide their use. METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned 308 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to receive furosemide administered intravenously by means of either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The protocol allowed specified dose adjustments after 48 hours. The coprimary end points were patients' global assessment of symptoms, quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the score on a visual-analogue scale over the course of 72 hours, and the change in the serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. RESULTS: In the comparison of bolus with continuous infusion, there was no significant difference in patients' global assessment of symptoms (mean AUC, 4236±1440 and 4373±1404, respectively; P = 0.47) or in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.05±0.3 mg per deciliter [4.4±26.5 ?mol per liter] and 0.07±0.3 mg per deciliter [6.2±26.5 μmol per liter], respectively; P = 0.45). In the comparison of the high-dose strategy with the low-dose strategy, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (mean AUC, 4430±1401 vs. 4171±1436; P = 0.06). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean change in the creatinine level (0.08±0.3 mg per deciliter [7.1±26.5 μmol per liter] with the high-dose strategy and 0.04±0.3 mg per deciliter [3.5±26.5 μmol per liter] with the low-dose strategy, P = 0.21). The high-dose strategy was associated with greater diuresis and more favorable outcomes in some secondary measures but also with transient worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose.

Some pharmacological data, however, are inconsistent with these conclusions. We have examined the cardiodynamic effects of discrete injections of a ganglionic blocking drug into two fat pads on the surface of the cat heart. These fat pads were shown to contain ganglion cells histologically. It was observed that vagal effects upon cardiac rate are selectively mediated by neurons located in ganglia overlying the right pulmonary veins at the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava. On the other hand, vagal effects upon AV conduction were selectively mediated by neurons located in a fat pad at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the inferior left atrium. These pharmacological data support the concept that specific intracardiac ganglia are capable of selective control of SA rate and AV conduction. © 1995.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatti","given":"Philip J"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Tannis A"},{"family":"Phan","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"I.

  {"id":"George2017","abstract":"The atrioventricular node (AVN) is a complex structure that performs a variety of functions in the heart. The AVN is primarily an electrical gatekeeper between the atria and ventricles and introduces a delay between atrial and ventricular excitation, allowing for efficient ventricular filling. The AVN is composed of several compartments that safely transmit electrical excitation from the atria to the ventricles via the fast or slow pathways. There are many electrophysiological differences between these pathways, including conduction time and electrical refractoriness, that increase the predisposition of the atrioventricular junction to arrhythmias such as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. These varied electrophysiological characteristics of the fast and slow pathways stem from their unique structural and molecular composition (tissue and cellular geometry, ion channels and gap junctions). This review summarises the structural and molecular heterogeneities of the human AVN and how they result in electrophysiological variations and arrhythmias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"Sharon A."},{"family":"Faye","given":"N.

  {"id":"Gerasimavicius2022","abstract":"Most known pathogenic mutations occur in protein-coding regions of DNA and change the way proteins are made. Taking protein structure into account has therefore provided great insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. While there has been much focus on how mutations can disrupt protein structure and thus cause a loss of function (LOF), alternative mechanisms, specifically dominant-negative (DN) and gain-of-function (GOF) effects, are less understood. Here, we investigate the protein-level effects of pathogenic missense mutations associated with different molecular mechanisms. We observe striking differences between recessive vs dominant, and LOF vs non-LOF mutations, with dominant, non-LOF disease mutations having much milder effects on protein structure, and DN mutations being highly enriched at protein interfaces. We also find that nearly all computational variant effect predictors, even those based solely on sequence conservation, underperform on non-LOF mutations. However, we do show that non-LOF mutations could potentially be identified by their tendency to cluster in three-dimensional space. Overall, our work suggests that many pathogenic mutations that act via DN and GOF mechanisms are likely being missed by current variant prioritisation strategies, but that there is considerable scope to improve computational predictions through consideration of molecular disease mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerasimavicius","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Livesey","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Joseph A."}],"citation-key":"Gerasimavicius2022","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-31686-6","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,6]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"3895","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mutations have profoundly different effects on protein structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31686-6","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Ghadri2016","abstract":"AIMS Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is typically provoked by negative stressors such as grief, anger, or fear leading to the popular term 'broken heart syndrome'. However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS. METHODS AND RESULTS Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional trigger. Of these, 4.1% (n = 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9% (n = 465) with unequivocal negative emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with 'happy heart syndrome' was similar to those with the 'broken heart syndrome' including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5% (17/19) vs. 90.2% (412/457), P = 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. However, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in 'happy hearts' compared with 'broken hearts' (35.0 vs. 16.3%, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient characteristics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the 'happy hearts' than among the 'broken hearts'. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghadri","given":"Jelena R"},{"family":"Sarcon","given":"Annahita"},{"family":"Diekmann","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Bataiosu","given":"Dana Roxana"},{"family":"Cammann","given":"Victoria L"},{"family":"Jurisic","given":"Stjepan"},{"family":"Napp","given":"Lars Christian"},{"family":"Jaguszewski","given":"Milosz"},{"family":"Scherff","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Brugger","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jäncke","given":"Lutz"},{"family":"Seifert","given":"Burkhardt"},{"family":"Bax","given":"Jeroen J"},{"family":"Ruschitzka","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Lüscher","given":"Thomas F."},{"family":"Templin","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Schwyzer","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"Franke","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Katus","given":"Hugo A"},{"family":"Burgdorf","given":"Christof"},{"family":"Schunkert","given":"Heribert"},{"family":"Thiele","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Bauersachs","given":"Johann"},{"family":"Tschöpe","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Rajan","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Michels","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Ukena","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Böhm","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Erbel","given":"Raimund"},{"family":"Cuneo","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Kuck","given":"Karl Heinz"},{"family":"Jacobshagen","given":"Claudius"},{"family":"Hasenfuß","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Karakas","given":"Mahir"},{"family":"Koenig","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Rottbauer","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Said","given":"Samir M"},{"family":"Braun-Dullaeus","given":"Ruediger C"},{"family":"Cuculi","given":"Florim"},{"family":"Banning","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Thomas A"},{"family":"Vasankari","given":"Tuija"},{"family":"Juhani Airaksinen","given":"K.

  {"id":"Ghelani2022","abstract":"Background\n\nLong‐term data to study recent trends in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), overall and among sex and race groups, are scarce. We evaluated the 30‐year trends in the incidence of AF in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study cohort and explored race and sex differences in these trends.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nWe included 15 343 men and women aged 45 to 64 years in 1987 to 1989 without AF from 4 US communities in the ARIC cohort. Incident AF was identified based on study ECGs, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates through 2017. We calculated age and period‐specific incidence rates (IRs) of AF. We used Poisson regression to calculate IR ratios of AF over time adjusting for age, sex, and race. A total of 3241 AF cases were identified during a mean (SD) follow‐up of 22 years (8.4 years) (599 in Black participants, 2642 in White participants, 1582 in women, and 1659 in men). Overall, the IR of AF in the ARIC cohort was 9.6 per 1000 person‐years (6.9 in Black participants, 10.5 in White participants, 8.1 in women, and 11.6 in men). Age‐specific IR by time period did not show significant changes over time. In a model adjusted for sex, race, and age group, the rate of AF did not change significantly from 1987 to 1991 compared with 2012 to 2017 (IR ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.88–1.36] comparing 2012–2017 with 1987–1991). Similarly, no evidence of changes over time in AF rates were identified in men and women or White and Black participants separately.\n\nConclusions\n\nEven though IRs of AF increase as age increases, our analysis provided evidence suggesting that the overall IRs of AF have not changed over time in a multicenter cohort of Black and White individuals in the United States from 1987 to 2017.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghelani","given":"Kunali P."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lin Yee"},{"family":"Norby","given":"Faye L."},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z."},{"family":"Koton","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"}],"citation-key":"Ghelani2022","container-title":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.121.023583","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,19]]},"page":"e023583","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Thirty‐Year Trends in the Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation: The ARIC Study","title-short":"Thirty‐Year Trends in the Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.023583","volume":"11"},

The lesion volume at 48 hours after MCAO was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in progesterone-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. All other mice underwent tests of well being (survival rate and body weight recovery), motor ability (grid test and rotarod), and cognitive ability (water maze) for up to 21 days. MCAO significantly worsened outcome in all of these tests compared with shams. Progesterone treatment was beneficial in that compared with vehicle, it significantly improved survival rate, weight recovery, and motor ability. This improvement was most apparent during water maze testing, where progesterone-treated mice were indistinguishable from shams in terms of acquiring the task.

However, no clinical trials examining hormone replacement therapy on outcome following ischemic stroke have investigated the effect of progesterone-only treatment. In this review the authors examine the experimental evidence for the neuroprotective potential of progesterone and give an insight into potential mechanisms of action following ischemic stroke. To date, 17 experimental studies have investigated the neuroprotective potential of progesterone for ischemic stroke in terms of ability to both reduce cell loss and increase functional outcome. Of these 17 published studies the majority reported a beneficial effect with three studies reporting a nil effect and only one study reporting a negative effect. However, there are important issues that the authors address in this review in terms of the methodological quality of studies in relation to the STAIR recommendations. In terms of the proposed mechanisms of progesterone neuroprotection we show that progesterone is versatile and acts at multiple targets to facilitate neuronal survival and minimize cell damage and loss. A large amount of experimental evidence indicates that progesterone is a neuroprotective candidate for ischemic stroke; however, to progress to clinical trial a number of key experimental studies remain outstanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"Claire L"},{"family":"Coomber","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Rathbone","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"gibson2009","container-title":"The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry","container-title-short":"Neuroscientist","DOI":"10.1177/1073858409333069","ISSN":"1073-8584","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8]]},"page":"324-332","PMID":"19359672","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Is progesterone a candidate neuroprotective factor for treatment following ischemic stroke?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/19359672","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"Gignac2016a","abstract":"Individual differences researchers very commonly report Pearson correlations between their variables of interest. Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for the purposes of interpreting the magnitude of a correlation, as well as estimating power. Specifically, r = 0.10, r = 0.30, and r = 0.50 were recommended to be considered small, medium, and large in magnitude, respectively. However, Cohen's effect size guidelines were based principally upon an essentially qualitative impression, rather than a systematic, quantitative analysis of data. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a large sample of previously published meta-analytically derived correlations which would allow for an evaluation of Cohen's guidelines from an empirical perspective. Based on 708 meta-analytically derived correlations, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlations of 0.11, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively. Based on the results, it is suggested that Cohen's correlation guidelines are too exigent, as < 3% of correlations in the literature were found to be as large as r = 0.50. Consequently, in the absence of any other information, individual differences researchers are recommended to consider correlations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 as relatively small, typical, and relatively large, in the context of a power analysis, as well as the interpretation of statistical results from a normative perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gignac","given":"Gilles E."},{"family":"Szodorai","given":"Eva T."}],"citation-key":"Gignac2016a","container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069","ISSN":"01918869","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,1]]},"page":"74-78","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Effect size guidelines for individual differences researchers","type":"article-journal","volume":"102"},

To inform this debate, we report survival data following cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in a cohort of critically ill patients with pneumonia or sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of arrest. Using Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, a US registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients, 3 we identified all adult patients (age 18 years and older) who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation for an index in-hospital cardiac arrest event. To simulate our study cohort as closely as possible to the COVID-19 population , we restricted our cohort to 5690 patients hospitalized in an ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia or sepsis during the hospitalization and who were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of arrest during 2014 to 2018. The study outcomes included survival to discharge, survival with a cerebral performance category (CPC) score of 1 (none to mild neurological disability), and survival with a CPC of 1 or 2 (no worse than moderate disability). We examined the above survival outcomes overall and stratified by patient age (categorized as <50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years), initial rhythm (asystole or pulseless electrical activity [PEA] versus ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia) and whether patients were receiving intravenous vasopressors at the time of arrest. All analyses were carried out using SAS. The study was reviewed by Saint Luke's Hospital's Mid America Heart Institute Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement for informed consent. Because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this study, requests to access the dataset from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation (GWTGResuscitationResearch@heart.org). The median age was 65 years. All patients were located in an ICU and were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of arrest. The initial cardiac arrest rhythm was asystole or PEA in a majority (87%) of patients and more than half (57%) were also receiving intravenous vasopressors at the time of arrest. The overall rate of survival to discharge was 12.5%. Rate of survival with CPC of 1 or 2 was 9.2% and survival with CPC of 1 was 6.2%.

Conventional clinical risk factors for these disorders may not be identified prior to mid-adult life when pathophysiological processes are already established. A better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of disease should facilitate early detection of individuals at risk and preventative intervention. Single rare variants of large effect size that are causative for CAD, AF, or predisposing factors such as hypertension or hyperlipidaemia, may give rise to familial forms of disease. However, in most individuals, CAD and AF are complex traits in which combinations of genetic and acquired factors play a role. Common genetic variants that affect disease susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies, but the predictive value of any single variant is limited. To address this issue, polygenic risk scores (PRS), comprised of suites of disease-associated common variants have been devised. In CAD and AF, incorporation of PRS into risk stratification algorithms has provided incremental prognostic information to clinical factors alone. The long-term health and economic benefits of PRS-guided clinical management remain to be determined however, and further evidence-based data are required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Gladding","given":"Patrick A."},{"family":"Legget","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Fatkin","given":"Diane"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Doughty","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"Gladding2020","collection-title":"Genetic Heart Diseases 2020","container-title":"Heart, Lung and Circulation","container-title-short":"Heart, Lung and Circulation","DOI":"10.1016/j.hlc.2019.12.004","ISSN":"1443-9506","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"634-640","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Polygenic Risk Scores in Coronary Artery Disease and Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950619315549","volume":"29"},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001. PATIENTS: A total of 369 patients with MDD (64% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74%; unstable angina, 26%). INTERVENTION: After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD.

  {"id":"Glassmana","abstract":"Context: Major depressive disorder (MDD) associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increases the risk of mortality. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV), also a predictor of mortality, is reduced in patients with MDD after ACS, and has been suggested to be a mediator of MDD mortality after ACS. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce mortality post-ACS, little is known about their effects on HRV. Objective: To examine the influence of both sertraline and improvement in mood on HRV. Methods: The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial assessed HRV from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings at baseline in 290 patients and from a second recording in 258 of these patients 16 weeks after randomization to sertraline or placebo. Frequency domain measures of HRV included high-frequency power, low-frequency power, very low-frequency power, ultra low-frequency power, and total power. Depression severity was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Clinical response was measured with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale. Results: At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low-frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD. Higher ultra low-frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. Conclusions: Heart rate variability recovery is impaired in depressed patients after ACS. Previously reported differences in baseline HRV between patients with and without depression after ACS grew larger in the 16 weeks following a coronary event. Both sertraline treatment and symptomatic recovery from depression were associated with increased HRV compared with placebotreated and nonrecovered post-ACS control groups, respectively, but this results primarily from decreased HRV in the comparison groups.","author":[{"family":"Glassman","given":"Alexander H."},{"family":"Bigger","given":"J.

Forty‐eight patients with ASA physical status 1 and 2 and without cardiovascular disease were included in the study. Thirty‐six patients scheduled for elective upper abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to Group 1 (TEA, bupivacaine 0.25%, n= 12), Group 2 (TEA, bupivacaine 0.5%, n = 12) or to Group 3 (control without TEA, n= 12). TEA induced a sensory block which extended over all cardiac segments. In order to assess the effect of systemically absorbed bupivacaine, we studied a separate group of patients who received lumbar epidural anesthesia without involvement of the cardiac segments: Group 4 (LEA, bupivacaine 0.5%, n= 10). Left ventricular contractility was assessed using the end‐systolic pressure‐length relationship. Left ventricular dimensions were measured by transesophageal echocardiography. All hemodynamic measurements were performed under general anesthesia. There was no significant difference in systolic or diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, left ventricular end‐systolic and end‐diastolic cross‐sectional areas and left ventricular wall stress between the four groups. Left ventricular maximum elastance as a measure of left ventricular contractility was significantly (P<0.001) reduced in Groups 1 and 2 [8.1 (±3.5) and 9.6 (±4.4) kPa · cm‐1, respectively] as compared to Groups 3 and 4 [18.4 (±8.8) and 17.7 (±7.7) kPa · cm‐1, respectively]. No significant difference could be demonstrated between Groups 1 and 2 or between Groups 3 and 4.

  {"id":"Goldberger1999a","abstract":"There are complex interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system inputs to the sinus node. The concept of “sympathovagal balance” reflects the autonomic state resulting from the sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. Despite widespread usage of a variety of heart rate (HR) variability parameters as indexes of sympathovagal balance, no index has been validated as a measure of sympathovagal balance. This study evaluated the utility of HR, HR variability, and a new parameter termed the vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) as indexes of sympathovagal balance. The ideal parameter had to satisfy the following criteria: 1) the index should vary similarly among subjects in response to different autonomic conditions; 2) the variability in the index among subjects exposed to the same autonomic conditions should be small; and 3) the response of the index to various autonomic conditions should reflect the underlying changes in physiological state and have a meaningful interpretation. Volunteers [8 men, 6 women; mean age 28.5 ± 4.8 (SD) yr] were evaluated for the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation and blockade on HR and HR variability. VSE was defined as the ratio of the R-R interval to the intrinsic R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval consistently changed in the expected directions with parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation and blockade. A general linearized model was used to evaluate the response of each parameter. VSE and R-R interval had r 2 values of 0.847 and 0.852, respectively. Natural logarithm of the low-frequency power had an r 2 value of 0.781 with lower r 2 values for all the other HR variability parameters. The coefficient of variation was also lowest for each condition tested for the VSE and the R-R interval. VSE and R-R interval best satisfy the criteria for the ideal index of sympathovagal balance. Because it is impractical under most conditions to measure the VSE as the index of sympathovagal balance, the most suitable index is the R-R interval.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldberger","given":"Jeffrey J"}],"citation-key":"Goldberger1999a","container-title":"American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.4.H1273","ISSN":"0363-6135","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",4,1]]},"page":"H1273-H1280","title":"Sympathovagal balance: how should we measure it?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.4.H1273","volume":"276"},

  {"id":"Goldberger2015","abstract":"Atrial disease or myopathy forms the substrate for atrial fibrillation (AF) and underlies the potential for atrial thrombus formation and subsequent stroke. Current diagnostic approaches in patients with AF focus on identifying clinical predictors with the evaluation of left atrial size by echocardiography serving as the sole measure specifically evaluating the atrium. Although the atrial substrate underlying AF is likely developing for years before the onset of AF, there is no current evaluation to identify the preclinical atrial myopathy. Atrial fibrosis is 1 component of the atrial substrate that has garnered recent attention based on newer MRI techniques that have been applied to visualize atrial fibrosis in humans with prognostic implications regarding the success of treatment. Advanced ECG signal processing, echocardiographic techniques, and MRI imaging of fibrosis and flow provide up-to-date approaches to evaluate the atrial myopathy underlying AF. Although thromboembolic risk is currently defined by clinical scores, their predictive value is mediocre. Evaluation of stasis via imaging and biomarkers associated with thrombogenesis may provide enhanced approaches to assess risk for stroke in patients with AF. Better delineation of the atrial myopathy that serves as the substrate for AF and thromboembolic complications might improve treatment outcomes. Furthermore, better delineation of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development of the atrial substrate for AF, particularly in its earlier stages, could help identify blood and imaging biomarkers that could be useful to assess risk for developing new-onset AF and suggest specific pathways that could be targeted for prevention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldberger","given":"Jeffrey J."},{"family":"Arora","given":"Rishi"},{"family":"Green","given":"David"},{"family":"Greenland","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Lloyd-Jones","given":"Donald M."},{"family":"Markl","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ng","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Sanjiv J."}],"citation-key":"Goldberger2015","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016795","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,28]]},"page":"278-291","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Evaluating the Atrial Myopathy Underlying Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016795","volume":"132"},

A multilevel neural network is responsible for control of chronotropy, lusitropy, dromotropy, and inotropy. Intrinsic autonomic dysfunction arises from diseases that directly affect the autonomic nerves, such as diabetes mellitus and the syndromes of primary autonomic failure. Extrinsic autonomic dysfunction reflects the changes in autonomic function that are secondarily induced by cardiac or other disease. An array of tests interrogate various aspects of cardiac autonomic control in either resting conditions or with physiological perturbations from resting conditions. The prognostic significance of these assessments have been well established. Clinical usefulness has not been established, and the precise mechanistic link to mortality is less well established.

  {"id":"Goldbogen2019","abstract":"The biology of the blue whale has long fascinated physiologists because of the animal’s extreme size. Despite high energetic demands from a large body, low mass-specific metabolic rates are likely powered by low heart rates. Diving bradycardia should slow blood oxygen depletion and enhance dive time available for foraging at depth. However, blue whales exhibit a high-cost feeding mechanism, lunge feeding, whereby large volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered during dives. This paradox of such a large, slowly beating heart and the high cost of lunge feeding represents a unique test of our understanding of cardiac function, hemodynamics, and physiological limits to body size. Here, we used an electrocardiogram (ECG)-depth recorder tag to measure blue whale heart rates during foraging dives as deep as 184 m and as long as 16.5 min. Heart rates during dives were typically 4 to 8 beats min−1 (bpm) and as low as 2 bpm, while after-dive surface heart rates were 25 to 37 bpm, near the estimated maximum heart rate possible. Despite extreme bradycardia, we recorded a 2.5-fold increase above diving heart rate minima during the powered ascent phase of feeding lunges followed by a gradual decrease of heart rate during the prolonged glide as engulfed water is filtered. These heart rate dynamics explain the unique hemodynamic design in rorqual whales consisting of a large-diameter, highly compliant, elastic aortic arch that allows the aorta to accommodate blood ejected by the heart and maintain blood flow during the long and variable pauses between heartbeats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"J.

  {"id":"Goldenberg2019","abstract":"Background Detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is complex and relies on combined assessment of traditional CAD risk factors and noninvasive testing. We hypothesized that a CAD-specific heart rate variability (HRV) algorithm can be used to improve detection of subclinical or early ischemia in patients without known CAD. Methods and Results Between 2014 and 2018 we prospectively enrolled 1043 patients with low to intermediate pretest probability for CAD who were screened for myocardial ischemia in tertiary medical centers in the United States and Israel. Patients underwent 1-hour Holter testing, with immediate HRV analysis using the HeartTrends DyDx algorithm, followed by exercise stress echocardiography (n=612) or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (n=431). The threshold for low HRV was identified using receiver operating characteristic analysis based on sensitivity and specificity. The primary end point was the presence of myocardial ischemia detected by exercise stress echocardiography or exercise myocardial perfusion imaging. The mean age of patients was 61 years and 38% were women. Myocardial ischemia was detected in 66 (6.3%) patients. After adjustment for CAD risk factors and exercise stress testing results, low HRV was independently associated with a significant 2-fold increased likelihood for myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.41-2.89 [P=0.01]). Adding HRV to traditional CAD risk factors significantly improved the pretest probability for myocardial ischemia. Conclusions Our data from a large prospective international clinical study show that short-term HRV testing can be used as a novel digital-health modality for enhanced risk assessment in low- to intermediate-risk individuals without known CAD.

We prospectively enrolled 450 subjects without known CAD who were referred to tertiary medical centers for exercise stress testing (EST) with single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All subjects underwent 1-hour Holter testing with subsequent HRV analysis before EST with MPI. The diagnostic yield of HRV analysis was compared with EST, using MPI as the gold standard for the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia. All subjects had intermediate pretest probability for CAD. Mean age was 62 years, 38% were women, 51% had hypertension, and 25% diabetes mellitus. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (77%) compared with standard EST (27%). After multivariate adjustment, HRV was independently associated with an 8.4-fold (p <0.001) increased likelihood for the detection of myocardial ischemia by MPI, whereas EST did not show a statistically significant association with a positive MPI (odds ratio 2.1; p = 0.12). Of subjects who were referred for subsequent coronary angiography, the respective sensitivities of HRV and EST for the detection of significant CAD were 73% versus 26%.

  {"id":"Goldstein2007","abstract":"This essay describes the evolution of stress as a medical scientific idea. Claude Bernard, Walter B. Cannon and Hans Selye provided key founding concepts for the current view. Bernard introduced the idea of the internal environment bathing cells - the milieu intérieur - maintained by continual compensatory changes of bodily functions. Cannon coined the word, \"homeostasis,\" referring to a set of acceptable ranges of values for internal variables. Cannon taught that threats to homeostasis evoke activation of the sympathoadrenal system as a functional unit. Selye defined stress as a state characterized by a uniform response pattern, regardless of the particular stressor, that could lead to long-term pathologic changes. \" Allostasis\" was introduced as a concept in recognition that there is no single ideal set of steady-state conditions in life; instead, setpoints and other response criteria change continuously. Stress is now viewed neither as a perturbation nor a stereotyped response pattern but as a condition characterized by a perceived discrepancy between information about a monitored variable and criteria for eliciting patterned effector responses. Different stressors elicit different patterns of activation of the sympathetic nervous, adrenomedullary hormonal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and other effectors, closing negative feedback loops.

  {"id":"Goldstein2019","abstract":"Homeostasis is a founding principle of integrative physiology. In current systems biology, however, homeostasis seems almost invisible. Is homeostasis a key goal driving body processes, or is it an emergent mechanistic fact? In this perspective piece, I propose that the integrative physiological and systems biological viewpoints about homeostasis reflect different epistemologies, different philosophies of knowledge. Integrative physiology is concept driven. It attempts to explain biological phenomena by continuous formation of theories that experimentation or observation can test. In integrative physiology, \"function\" refers to goals or purposes. Systems biology is data driven. It explains biological phenomena in terms of \"omics\"-i.e., genomics, gene expression, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-it depicts the data in computer models of complex cascades or networks, and it makes predictions from the models. In systems biology, \"function\" refers more to mechanisms than to goals. The integrative physiologist emphasizes homeostasis of internal variables such as Pco2 and blood pressure. The systems biologist views these emphases as teleological and unparsimonious in that the \"regulated variable\" (e.g., arterial Pco2 and blood pressure) and the \"regulator\" (e.g., the \"carbistat\" and \"barostat\") are unobservable constructs. The integrative physiologist views systems biological explanations as not really explanations but descriptions that cannot account for phenomena we humans believe exist, although they cannot be observed directly, such as feelings and, ultimately, the conscious mind. This essay reviews the history of the two epistemologies, emphasizing autonomic neuroscience. I predict rapprochement of integrative physiology with systems biology. The resolution will avoid teleological purposiveness, transcend pure mechanism, and incorporate adaptiveness in evolution, i.e., \"Darwinian medicine.\"","author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"Goldstein2019","container-title":"American journal of physiology.

  {"id":"Goodwill2017","abstract":"A very schematic summary of possible factors that affect coronary vascular resistance is illustrated in Fig. 11. These factors are mechanical, myogenic, metabolic, and neural.64 Mechanical influence is passive and is essentially determined by the extravascular compression which is important only during systole and particularly in the subendocardial layers of the left ventricular myocardium. With respect to the myogenic factor it is controversial whether it plays a role in adjustments of coronary vascular tone. Metabolic processes are possibly integrated at the level of the myocardial cell PO2 which is the resultant of oxygen supply and need, which in turn depend on the myocardial contractile activity as well as other biochemical processes. A decrease in myocardial PO2 gives rise to the release of the vasodilator metabolite adenosine. Nevertheless, other chemical factors (H+, K+, osmolarity) known to be released by the heart (which by themselves are poor and transient coronary vasodilators and whose release does not correspond with changes in coronary resistance) may play a role by modulating the coronary sensitivity to adenosine and other factors. © 1975.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Goodwill","given":"Adam G"},{"family":"Dick","given":"Gregory M"},{"family":"Kiel","given":"Alexander M"},{"family":"Tune","given":"Johnathan D"}],"citation-key":"Goodwill2017","container-title":"Comprehensive Physiology","DOI":"10.1002/cphy.c160016","ISSN":"20404603","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"321-382","title":"Regulation of coronary blood flow","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Comprehensive quantitative myocardial perfusion offers new insights beyond overly simplistic coronary flow reserve. Integrating regional absolute stress flow, relative stress flow, coronary flow reserve, and qualitative subendocardial perfusion gradient on tomograms of relative images, provides correct diagnosis, quantitative physiological classification, and potential treatment. Angina without angiographic stenosis is associated with abnormal quantitative perfusion with rare, but instructive, exceptions. However, microvascular dysfunction without angina is common, particularly associated with risk factors. Reduced subendocardial/epicardial relative activity is common with diffuse coronary artery disease without focal stenosis with or without angina depending on the severity of reduced subendocardial perfusion. Precision quantitative myocardial perfusion in 5,900 cases objectively classifies angina with no angiographic stenosis into 4 categories: subendocardial ischemia due to diffuse coronary artery disease (most common), overlooked stenosis, diffuse microvascular dysfunction due to risk factors or specific microvasculopathies, and nonischemic cardiac pain mechanisms (rare), or some mix of these prototypes, of which 95% associate with risk factors, or subclinical or clinically manifest coronary atherosclerosis needing vigorous risk factor treatment.","author":[{"family":"Gould","given":"K.

  {"id":"Granada2000","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to determine the incidence and predictors of atrial flutter in the general population. BACKGROUND: Although atrial flutter can now be cured, there are no reports on its epidemiology in unselected patients. METHODS: The Marshfield Epidemiological Study Area (MESA), a database that captures nearly all medical care among its 58,820 residents was used to ascertain all new cases of atrial flutter diagnosed from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1995. To identify predisposing risk factors, we employed an age- and gender-matched case-control study design using eight additional variables. RESULTS: A total of 181 new cases of atrial flutter were diagnosed for an overall incidence of 88/100,000 person-years. Incidence rates ranged from 5/100,000 in those <50 years old to 587/100,000 in subjects older than 80. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men (p < 0.001). The risk of developing atrial flutter increased 3.5 times (p < 0.001) in subjects with heart failure and 1.9 times (p < 0.001) for subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Among those with atrial flutter 16% were attributable to heart failure and 12% to chronic obstructive lung disease. Three subjects (1.7%) without identifiable predisposing risks were labeled as having 'lone atrial flutter.' CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first population-based investigation of atrial flutter, suggests this curable condition is much more common than previously appreciated. If our findings were applicable to the entire U.S. population, we estimate 200,000 new cases of atrial flutter in this country annually. At highest risk of developing atrial flutter are men, the elderly and individuals with preexisting heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease.

Data were collected from April 2012 through June 2013 and analyzed in October 2014.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD.\nRESULTS: Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of AUD were 13.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Prevalence was generally highest for men (17.6% and 36.0%, respectively), white (14.0% and 32.6%, respectively) and Native American (19.2% and 43.4%, respectively), respondents, and younger (26.7% and 37.0%, respectively) and previously married (11.4% and 27.1%, respectively) or never married (25.0% and 35.5%, respectively) adults. Prevalence of 12-month and lifetime severe AUD was greatest among respondents with the lowest income level (1.8% and 1.5%, respectively). Significant disability was associated with 12-month and lifetime AUD and increased with the severity of AUD. Only 19.8% of respondents with lifetime AUD were ever treated. Significant associations were found between 12-month and lifetime AUD and other substance use disorders, major depressive and bipolar I disorders, and antisocial and borderline personality disorders across all levels of AUD severity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.08-1.36) to 6.4 (95% CI, 5.76-7.22). Associations between AUD and panic disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety disorder were modest (odds ratios ranged from 1.2 (95% CI, 1.01-1.43) to 1.4 (95% CI, 1.13-1.67) across most levels of AUD severity.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alcohol use disorder defined by DSM-5 criteria is a highly prevalent, highly comorbid, disabling disorder that often goes untreated in the United States. The NESARC-III data indicate an urgent need to educate the public and policy makers about AUD and its treatment alternatives, to destigmatize the disorder, and to encourage those who cannot reduce their alcohol consumption on their own, despite substantial harm to themselves and others, to seek treatment.","author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"Bridget F."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Risë B."},{"family":"Saha","given":"Tulshi D."},{"family":"Chou","given":"S.

  {"id":"Grassler2021","abstract":"Introduction: Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation of adjacent heartbeats, is an indicator of the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Increased HRV reflects well-functioning of autonomic control mechanism and cardiovascular health. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a systematic overview of the effects of different physical training modalities on resting HRV and cardiovascular health and risk factors (i.e., baroreflex sensitivity, body fat, body mass, body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate recovery, VO2 max, and VO2 peak) in young and middle-aged (mean age of the studies samples up to 44 years), healthy adults.Methods: A systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines was performed. Studies investigating the effects of different physical interventions (endurance, resistance, high-intensity, coordinative, or multimodal training) on HRV were included. Trials were considered eligible if the intervention lasted for at least 4 weeks and participants were regarded as general healthy. Five electronic databases were searched from 2005 to September 8th, 2020. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed by two study quality and reporting assessment scales (TESTEX and STARDHRV). PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020206606.Results: Of 3,991 retrieved records, 26 were considered eligible and analyzed. Twelve studies used an endurance training (of which three included high-intensity sessions), six studies resistance training, four studies coordinative training, two studies high-intensity training, and two studies used a multimodal intervention. Overall, the results showed for all types of intervention an improvement in linear and non-linear HRV parameters and cardiovascular health and risk factors. However, quality assessment revealed some methodological and reporting deficits.Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the benefits of different types of physical training interventions on autonomic function and health parameters in young and middle-aged, healthy adults. In conclusion, higher training intensities and frequencies are more likely to improve HRV. For future studies, we recommend adhering to the criteria of methodological standards of exercise interventions and HRV measurements and encourage the use of non-linear HRV parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Grässler","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Thielmann","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Böckelmann","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Hökelmann","given":"Anita"}],"citation-key":"Grassler2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","ISSN":"1664-042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Effects of Different Training Interventions on Heart Rate Variability and Cardiovascular Health and Risk Factors in Young and Middle-Aged Adults: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Effects of Different Training Interventions on Heart Rate Variability and Cardiovascular Health and Risk Factors in Young and Middle-Aged Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.657274","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Gray2004","abstract":"Intracardiac pathways mediating the parasympathetic control of various cardiac functions are incompletely understood. Several intracardiac ganglia have been demonstrated to potently influence cardiac rate [the sinoatrial (SA) ganglion], atrioventricular (AV) conduction (the AV ganglion), or left ventricular contractility (the cranioventricular ganglion). However, there are numerous ganglia found throughout the heart whose functions are poorly characterized. One such ganglion, the posterior atrial (PA) ganglion, is found in a fat pad on the rostral dorsal surface of the right atrium. We have investigated the potential impact of this ganglion on cardiac rate and AV conduction. We report that microinjections of a ganglionic blocker into the PA ganglion significantly attenuates the negative chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation without significantly influencing negative dromotropic effects. Because prior evidence indicates that the PA ganglion does not project to the SA node, we neuroanatomically tested the hypothesis that the PA ganglion mediates its effect on cardiac rate through an interganglionic projection to the SA ganglion. Subsequent to micro-injections of the retrograde tracer fast blue into the SA ganglion, >70% of the retrogradely labeled neurons found within five intracardiac ganglia throughout the heart were observed in the PA ganglion. The neuroanatomic data further indicate that intraganglionic neuronal circuits are found within the SA ganglion. The present data support the hypothesis that two interacting cardiac centers, i.e., the SA and PA ganglia, mediate the peripheral parasympathetic control of cardiac rate. These data further support the emerging concept of an intrinsic cardiac nervous system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Alrich L."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Tannis A"},{"family":"Ardell","given":"Jeffrey L."},{"family":"Massari","given":"V John"}],"citation-key":"Gray2004","container-title":"Journal of Applied Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/japplphysiol.00616.2003","ISSN":"8750-7587","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"2273-2278","title":"Parasympathetic control of the heart.

They demonstrate that the review's search strategy was limited, failing to capture many important evaluation studies. They also question the appropriateness of the analysis of the included articles, which focused, to the exclusion of other important properties, on an instrument's ability to discriminate among residents' performance in the six competencies.Finally, the authors argue that the problem is not the lack of adequate evaluation instruments but, rather, the inconsistent use and interpretation of such instruments by unskilled faculty.

  {"id":"Greenberg2015b","abstract":"Background: The economic burden of depression in the United States-including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia-was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders. Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5% (from $173.2 billion to $210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. Only 38% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Paul E."},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Andree Anne"},{"family":"Sisitsky","given":"Tammy"},{"family":"Pike","given":"Crystal T."},{"family":"Kessler","given":"Ronald C."}],"citation-key":"Greenberg2015b","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.14m09298","ISSN":"01606689","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,1]]},"page":"155-162","PMID":"25742202","publisher":"Physicians Postgraduate Press Inc.","title":"The economic burden of adults with major depressive disorder in the United States (2005 and 2010)","type":"article-journal","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"Grippo2002","abstract":"Psychological depression is shown to be associated with several aspects of coronary artery disease (CAD), including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden death. The physiological mechanisms accounting for this association are unclear. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, diminished heart rate variability, altered blood platelet function and noncompliance with medial treatments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying depression and cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence also suggests that reduced baroreflex sensitivity, impaired immune function, chronic fatigue and the co-morbidity of depression and anxiety may be involved in the relationship between depression and cardiovascular dysregulation. An experimental strategy using animal models for investigating underlying physiological abnormalities in depression is presented. A key to understanding the bidirectional association between depression and heart disease is to determine whether there are common changes in brain systems that are associated with these conditions. Such approaches may hold promise for advancing our understanding of the interaction between this mood disorder and CAD. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  {"id":"Grune2021","abstract":"Conduction disorders and arrhythmias remain difficult to treat and are increasingly prevalent owing to the increasing age and body mass of the general population, because both are risk factors for arrhythmia. Many of the underlying conditions that give rise to arrhythmia — including atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia, which frequently occur in patients with acute myocardial ischaemia or heart failure — can have an inflammatory component. In the past, inflammation was viewed mostly as an epiphenomenon associated with arrhythmia; however, the recently discovered inflammatory and non-canonical functions of cardiac immune cells indicate that leukocytes can be arrhythmogenic either by altering tissue composition or by interacting with cardiomyocytes; for example, by changing their phenotype or perhaps even by directly interfering with conduction. In this Review, we discuss the electrophysiological properties of leukocytes and how these cells relate to conduction in the heart. Given the thematic parallels, we also summarize the interactions between immune cells and neural systems that influence information transfer, extrapolating findings from the field of neuroscience to the heart and defining common themes. We aim to bridge the knowledge gap between electrophysiology and immunology, to promote conceptual connections between these two fields and to explore promising opportunities for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Grune","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Yamazoe","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Nahrendorf","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"Grune2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cardiology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Cardiol","DOI":"10.1038/s41569-021-00520-9","ISSN":"1759-5010","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"8","page":"547-564","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Electroimmunology and cardiac arrhythmia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-021-00520-9","volume":"18"},

We evaluated the autonomic response to stress reactivity of young healthy subjects and aging subjects with coronary artery disease to understand how the autonomic stress response differs with aging. Methods Physiologic reactivity to arithmetic stress in a cohort of 25 young, healthy subjects (< 30 years) and another cohort of 25 older subjects (> 55 years) with CAD was evaluated using electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and arterial pressure recordings. Stress-related changes in the pre-ejection period (PEP), which measures sympathetic activity, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), which measures parasympathetic activity, were analyzed as primary outcomes. Results Mental stress reduced PEP in both groups (p<0.01), although the decrease was 50% greater in the healthy group. Mean HF HRV decreased significantly in the aging group only (p = 0.01). Discussion PEP decreases with stress regardless of health and age status, implying increased sympathetic function. Its decline with stress may be attenuated in CAD. The HF HRV (parasympathetic) stress reactivity is more variable and attenuated in younger individuals; perhaps this is related to a protective parasympathetic reflex.

DAGWOOD combines a root DAG (the DAG in the proposed analysis) and a set of branch DAGs (alternative hidden assumptions to the root DAG). All branch DAGs share a common ruleset, and must 1) change the root DAG, 2) be a valid DAG, and either 3a) change the minimally sufficient adjustment set or 3b) change the number of frontdoor paths. Branch DAGs comprise a list of assumptions which must be justified as negligible. We define two types of branch DAGs: exclusion branch DAGs add a single- or bidirectional pathway between two nodes in the root DAG (e.g., direct pathways and colliders), while misdirection branch DAGs represent alternative pathways that could be drawn between objects (e.g., creating a collider by reversing the direction of causation for a controlled confounder).

Methods and Results - We identified 5183 consecutive patients who underwent stress/rest SPECT and were followed up for the occurrence of cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Over a mean follow up of 642±226 days, 119 cardiac deaths and 158 myocardial infarctions occurred (3.0% cardiac death rate, 2.3% myocardial infarction rate). Patients with normal scans were at low risk (≤0.5%/y), and rates of both outcomes increased significantly with worsening scan abnormalities. Patients who underwent exercise stress and had mildly abnormal scans had low rates of cardiac death but higher rates of myocardial infarction (0.7%/y versus 2.6%/y; P<.05). After adjustment for prescan information, scan results provided incremental prognostic value toward the prediction of cardiac death. The identification of patients at intermediate risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and low risk for cardiac death by SPECT may result in significant cost savings when applied to a clinical testing strategy. Conclusions - Myocardial perfusion SPECT yields incremental prognostic information toward the identification of cardiac death. Patients with mildly abnormal scans after exercise stress are at low risk for cardiac death but intermediate risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction and thus may benefit from a noninvasive strategy and may not require invasive management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hachamovitch","given":"Rory"},{"family":"Berman","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Leslee J."},{"family":"Kiat","given":"Hosen"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Ishac"},{"family":"Arthur Cabico","given":"J."},{"family":"Friedman","given":"John"},{"family":"Diamond","given":"George A."}],"citation-key":"Hachamovitch1998","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.97.6.535","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",2,17]]},"page":"535-543","PMID":"9494023","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","title":"Incremental prognostic value of myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography for the prediction of cardiac death: Differential stratification for risk of cardiac death and myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.97.6.535","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Haghikia2013","abstract":"Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a life-threatening heart disease developing towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery in previously healthy women in terms of cardiac disease. Enhanced oxidative stress and the subsequent cleavage of the nursing hormone Prolactin into an anti-angiogenic 16 kDa subfragment emerged as a potential causal factor of the disease. We established a prospective registry with confirmed PPCM present in 115 patients (mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF: 27 +/- 9 %). Follow-up data (6 +/- 3 months) showed LVEF improvement in 85 % and full recovery in 47 % while 15 % failed to recover with death in 2 % of patients. A positive family history of cardiomyopathy was present in 16.5 %. Pregnancy-associated hypertension was associated with a better outcome while a baseline LVEF </= 25 % was associated with a worse outcome. A high recovery rate (96 %) was observed in patients obtaining combination therapy with beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) and bromocriptine. Increased serum levels of Cathepsin D, the enzyme that generates 16 kDa Prolactin, miR-146a, a direct target of 16 kDa Prolactin, N-terminal-pro-brain-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) emerged as biomarkers for PPCM. In conclusion, low baseline LVEF is a predictor for poor outcome while pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders are associated with a better outcome in this European PPCM cohort. The high recovery rate in this collective is associated with a treatment concept using beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and bromocriptine. Increased levels of Cathepsin D activity, miR-146a and ADMA in serum of PPCM patients support the pathophysiological role of 16 kDa Prolactin for PPCM and may be used as a specific diagnostic marker profile.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haghikia","given":"A"},{"family":"Podewski","given":"E"},{"family":"Libhaber","given":"E"},{"family":"Labidi","given":"S"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"D"},{"family":"Roentgen","given":"P"},{"family":"Tsikas","given":"D"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"J"},{"family":"Lichtinghagen","given":"R"},{"family":"Von Kaisenberg","given":"C.

  {"id":"Hall2016a","abstract":"Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an adverse and sustained increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), triggering potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. While myocardial reperfusion undoubtedly improves patient prognosis, it remains unknown whether reperfusion therapy also attenuates the dangerous increase in SNA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of time-dependent coronary reperfusion therapy on cardiac SNA following acute MI. Electrophysiological recordings of cardiac efferent SNA were performed in urethane-anaesthetized rats following ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (i.e., MI) for either 15 or 45 min, followed by ‘early’ or ‘delayed’ reperfusion, respectively. Another group of rats had permanent ischemia with no reperfusion. Forty-five minutes of ischemia induced a 55 % increase in efferent SNA. Subsequent ‘delayed’ reperfusion was ineffective at ameliorating further increases in SNA (maximal 153 % increase), so that MI-induced increases in SNA mirrored that observed in rats with permanent MI. Although SNA did not increase during 15 min of ischemia, it did significantly increase, albeit delayed, during the subsequent reperfusion period (max. 75 % increase). Importantly, however, this increase in SNA, which tended to be lower in the ‘early’-reperfusion group, was matched with a lower incidence of arrhythmias and mortality rate, compared to the ‘delayed’-reperfusion and permanent-MI groups. These results highlight that ‘prompt’ coronary reperfusion, before SNA becomes activated, may provide a crucial window of opportunity for improving outcome. Further research is essential to identify the mechanisms that underpin, not only sympathetic activation, but also importantly sympathetic deactivation as a potential therapeutic target for MI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Ranjan"},{"family":"Schwenke","given":"Daryl O."}],"citation-key":"Hall2016a","container-title":"Basic Research in Cardiology","DOI":"10.1007/s00395-016-0556-3","ISSN":"14351803","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"publisher":"Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH and Co.

  {"id":"Hammadah2017a","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but contemporary studies of its prognostic significance and its underlying pathophysiology are limited. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed CAD in the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent mental stress testing using a standardized public speaking task, and ischemia was detected by Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging. Patients also underwent conventional stress testing for myocardial ischemia (CSIMI) using exercise or pharmacological stress testing. Furthermore, digital microvascular flow, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, and blood sample collections were performed before, during, and after mental stress. Two-year adverse clinical outcomes are being assessed. RESULTS Six-hundred ninety-five patients completed baseline enrollment in the MIPS. Their mean (standard deviation) age was 62.9 (9.1) years, 72% were men, 30% were African American, and 32% had a history myocardial infarction. The prevalence of MSIMI and CSIMI is 16.1% and 34.7%, respectively. A total of 151 patients (22.9%) had only CSIMI, 28 (4.2%) had only MSIMI, and 78 (11.8%) had both MSIMI and CSIMI. Patients with ischemia had a lower ejection fraction and higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting compared with those without inducible ischemia (p < .050). The prevalence of obstructive CAD was not statistically different between patients with and without MSIMI (p = .426); in contrast, it was higher in patients with CSIMI (p < .001).

  {"id":"Hammadah2018a","abstract":"Background: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We measured the inflammatory response to acute laboratory mental stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and its association with MSIMI. We hypothesized that patients with MSIMI would have a higher inflammatory response to mental stress in comparison to those without ischemia. Methods: Patients with stable CAD underwent 99mTc sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress testing using a public speaking stressor. MSIMI was determined as impaired myocardial perfusion using a 17-segment model. Inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at rest and 90 min after mental stress. Results were validated in an independent sample of 228 post-myocardial infarction patients. Results: Of 607 patients analyzed in this study, (mean age 63 ± 9 years, 76% male), 99 (16.3%) developed MSIMI. Mental stress resulted in a significant increase in IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9 (all p <0.0001), but not hsCRP. However, the changes in these markers were similar in those with and without MSIMI. Neither resting levels of these biomarkers, nor their changes with mental stress were significantly associated with MSIMI. Results in the replication sample were similar. Conclusion: Mental stress is associated with acute increases in several inflammatory markers. However, neither the baseline inflammatory status nor the magnitude of the inflammatory response to mental stress over 90 min were significantly associated with MSIMI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Brad"},{"family":"Al Mheid","given":"Ibhar"},{"family":"Wilmot","given":"Kobina"},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Tahhan","given":"Ayman Samman"},{"family":"O'Neal","given":"Wesley T."},{"family":"Obideen","given":"Malik"},{"family":"Alkhoder","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Abdelhadi","given":"Naser"},{"family":"Mohamed Kelli","given":"Heval"},{"family":"Ghafeer","given":"Mohamad Mazen"},{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Sandesara","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Hosny","given":"Kareem Mohammed"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Ko","given":"Yi An"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yan V."},{"family":"Weng","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Kutner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Hammadah2018b","abstract":"BACKGROUND Coronary microvascular dysfunction may contribute to myocardial ischemia during mental stress (MS). However, the role of coronary epicardial and microvascular function in regulating coronary blood flow (CBF) responses during MS remains understudied. We hypothesized that coronary vasomotion during MS is dependent on the coronary microvascular endothelial function and will be reflected in the peripheral microvascular circulation. METHODS AND RESULTS In 38 patients aged 59±8 years undergoing coronary angiography, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent coronary epicardial and microvascular responses were measured using intracoronary acetylcholine and nitroprusside, respectively, and after MS induced by mental arithmetic testing. Peripheral microvascular tone during MS was measured using peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc, Caesarea, Israel) as the ratio of digital pulse wave amplitude compared to rest (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio). MS increased the rate-pressure product by 22% (±23%) and constricted epicardial coronary arteries by -5.9% (-10.5%, -2.6%) (median [interquartile range]), P=0.001, without changing CBF. Acetylcholine increased CBF by 38.5% (8.1%, 91.3%), P=0.001, without epicardial coronary diameter change (0.1% [-10.9%, 8.2%], P=not significant). The MS-induced CBF response correlated with endothelium-dependent CBF changes with acetylcholine (r=0.38, P=0.03) but not with the response to nitroprusside. The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio also correlated with the demand-adjusted change in CBF during MS (r=-0.60, P=0.004), indicating similarity between the microcirculatory responses to MS in the coronary and peripheral microcirculation. CONCLUSIONS The coronary microvascular response to MS is determined by endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary microvascular function.

We propose a new automated technique to identify bursts through objective detection criteria, eliminating artifacts and preserving a beat-by-beat SNA signal for a variety of subsequent analyses. The technique was evaluated during both steady-state conditions (17 subjects) and dynamic changes with rapid vasoactive drug infusion (14 recordings from 5 subjects) on SNA signals of widely varied quality. Automated measures of SNA were highly correlated to visual measures of steady-state activity ( r = 0.903, P < 0.001), dynamic relation measures ( r= 0.987, P < 0.001), and measures of burst-by-burst variability ( r = 0.929, P < 0.001).

  {"id":"Hannun2019","abstract":"Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hannun","given":"Awni Y."},{"family":"Rajpurkar","given":"Pranav"},{"family":"Haghpanahi","given":"Masoumeh"},{"family":"Tison","given":"Geoffrey H."},{"family":"Bourn","given":"Codie"},{"family":"Turakhia","given":"Mintu P."},{"family":"Ng","given":"Andrew Y."}],"citation-key":"Hannun2019","container-title":"Nature Medicine","container-title-short":"Nat Med","DOI":"10.1038/s41591-018-0268-3","ISSN":"1546-170X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"1","page":"65-69","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Cardiologist-level arrhythmia detection and classification in ambulatory electrocardiograms using a deep neural network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0268-3","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"Hardwick2014","abstract":"Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with remodeling of the heart and neurohumoral control systems. The objective of this study was to define time-dependent changes in intrinsic cardiac (IC) neuronal excitability, synaptic efficacy, and neurochemical modulation following MI. MI was produced in guinea pigs by ligation of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Animals were recovered for 4, 7, 14, or 50. days. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained in whole mounts of the cardiac neuronal plexus to determine passive and active neuronal properties of IC neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an immediate and persistent increase in the percentage of IC neurons immunoreactive for neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Examination of individual neuronal properties demonstrated that afterhyperpolarizing potentials were significantly decreased in both amplitude and time course of recovery at 7. days post-MI. These parameters returned to control values by 50. days post-MI. Synaptic efficacy, as determined by the stimulation of axonal inputs, was enhanced at 7. days post-MI only. Neuronal excitability in absence of agonist challenge was unchanged following MI. Norepinephrine increased IC excitability to intracellular current injections, a response that was augmented post-MI. Angiotensin II potentiation of norepinephrine and bethanechol-induced excitability, evident in controls, was abolished post-MI. This study demonstrates that MI induces both persistent and transient changes in IC neuronal functions immediately following injury. Alterations in the IC neuronal network, which persist for weeks after the initial insult, may lead to alterations in autonomic signaling and cardiac control. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hardwick","given":"Jean C"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Shannon E"},{"family":"Beaumont","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Ardell","given":"Jeffrey L"},{"family":"Southerland","given":"E Marie"}],"citation-key":"Hardwick2014","container-title":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2013.10.008","ISSN":"15660702","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"4-12","title":"Dynamic remodeling of the guinea pig intrinsic cardiac plexus induced by chronic myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autneu.2013.10.008","volume":"181"},

There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. © The Author 2013.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hare","given":"David L"},{"family":"Toukhsati","given":"Samia R"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jaarsma","given":"Tiny"}],"citation-key":"Hare2014","container-title":"European Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/eht462","ISSN":"15229645","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,1]]},"page":"1365-1372","PMID":"24282187","title":"Depression and cardiovascular disease: A clinical review","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282187","volume":"35"},

Permeability of the blood-brain barrier to small or large molecules was evaluated qualitatively using Evans blue or sodium fluorescein and quantitatively using the transfer indexes of iodine-125-labeled bovine serum albumin or [14C]sucrose. Water content was determined using wet and dry weights and sodium and potassium contents using flame photometry. Cortical tissue in the middle cerebral artery territory was sampled less than or equal to 14 days after occlusion. A significant increase in the albumin transfer index was first found 12 hours after occlusion, and the index remained approximately the same until water content peaked 3 days after occlusion. In contrast, the sucrose transfer index increased gradually, significantly correlated with increases in the water and sodium contents. Tissue staining by sodium fluorescein was more extensive than that by Evans blue. As edema fluid decreased gradually 4-10 days after occlusion, the albumin and sucrose transfer indexes increased markedly. These findings indicate that disruption of the blood-brain barrier to small molecules is accompanied by accumulation of edema fluid during the later stages of ischemia. Opening of the barrier to serum protein is probably related to the resolution of edema.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hatashita","given":"S"},{"family":"Hoff","given":"J T"}],"citation-key":"hatashita1990","container-title":"Stroke; a Journal of Cerebral Circulation","container-title-short":"Stroke","ISSN":"0039-2499","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",4]]},"page":"582-588","PMID":"1691534","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Brain edema and cerebrovascular permeability during cerebral ischemia in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/1691534","volume":"21"},

Although resuscitation rates are generally improving throughout the world, the majority of individuals who experience a sudden cardiac arrest will not survive. SCD most often develops in older adults with acquired structural heart disease, but it also rarely occurs in the young, where it is more commonly because of inherited disorders. Coronary heart disease is known to be the most common pathology underlying SCD, followed by cardiomyopathies, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, and valvular heart disease. During the past 3 decades, declines in SCD rates have not been as steep as for other causes of coronary heart disease deaths, and there is a growing fraction of SCDs not due to coronary heart disease and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly among certain subsets of the population. The growing heterogeneity of the pathologies and mechanisms underlying SCD present major challenges for SCD prevention, which are magnified further by a frequent lack of recognition of the underlying cardiac condition before death. Multifaceted preventative approaches, which address risk factors in seemingly low-risk and known high-risk populations, will be required to decrease the burden of SCD. In this Compendium, we review the wide-ranging spectrum of epidemiology underlying SCD within both the general population and in high-risk subsets with established cardiac disease placing an emphasis on recent global trends, remaining uncertainties, and potential targeted preventive strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Meiso"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Wataru"},{"family":"Albert","given":"Christine M."}],"citation-key":"Hayashi2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304521","ISBN":"0009-7330","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"1887-1906","PMID":"26044246","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Hagerstown, MD","title":"The Spectrum of Epidemiology Underlying Sudden Cardiac Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304521","volume":"116"},

In this paper, we present a case where a tumor (<0.5 cm) was detected in the right upper lobe of a 71-year old woman. Cells of the tumor displayed markers characterizing for their neuroendocrine origin. No histological evidence for inflammation, interstitial fibrosis and remodeling of vascular structure was observed. However, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated a strong production of the profibrotic factors VEGF and TGF-β1 by tumor cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of atrial GP stimulation (GPS) on ventricular refractoriness, restitution properties and electrical alternans. Methods: In 12 anesthetized dogs, two multiple electrode catheters were sutured at left and right ventricular free walls for recording. Monophasic action potentials were recorded from six epicardial ventricular sites. Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and APD alternans were measured at baseline and during GPS. Results: Compared with baseline, GPS significantly prolonged ventricular ERP and APD at all sites and decreased their spatial dispersions (P < 0.05 for all). GPS also significantly flattened ventricular restitution curves and decreased the maximal slope of restitution curves at each site (P < 0.05 for all). APD alternans occurred at shorter pacing cycle length at each site during GPS when compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: GPS prolonged ventricular ERP, decreased the slope of restitution curves and delayed APD alternans, indicating that GPS may exert a protective role for ventricular arrhythmias. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhibing"},{"family":"He","given":"Wenbo"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Lilei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Xiaorong"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Hong"}],"citation-key":"He2013","container-title":"Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1007/s10840-012-9774-2","ISSN":"1383875X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"1-8","title":"The effects of atrial ganglionated plexi stimulation on ventricular electrophysiology in a normal canine heart","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

Monotone likelihood primarily occurs in small samples with substantial censoring of survival times and several highly predictive covariates. Previous options to deal with monotone likelihood have been unsatisfactory. The solution we suggest is an adaptation of a procedure by Firth (1993, Biometrika 80, 27-38) originally developed to reduce the bias of maximum likelihood estimates. This procedure produces finite parameter estimates by means of penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Corresponding Wald-type tests and confidence intervals are available, but it is shown that penalized likelihood ratio tests and profile penalized likelihood confidence intervals are often preferable. An empirical study of the suggested procedures confirms satisfactory performance of both estimation and inference.

Furthermore, the use of programmed electrical stimulation enables determination of parameters such as sinoatrial conduction time, sinus node recovery time, atrioventricular-nodal conduction properties, Wenckebach periodicity, refractory periods and arrhythmia vulnerability. This protocol describes specific procedures for determining these parameters that were adapted from analogous human protocols for use in mice. We include details of ex vivo electrophysiological study, which provides detailed insights into intrinsic cardiac electrophysiology without external influences from humoral and neural factors. In addition, we describe a heart preparation with intact innervation by the vagus nerve that can be used as an ex vivo model for vagal control of the cardiac conduction system. Data acquisition for in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological study takes ~1 h per mouse, depending on the number of stimulation protocols applied during the procedure.

OBJECTIVE: To perform ameta-analysis to identify the most accurate clinical examination findings for RCD. DATA SOURCES: Structured search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL from their inception through May 2013. STUDY SELECTION: For inclusion, a study must havemet the following criteria: (1) description of history taking, physical examination, or clinical tests concerning RCD; (2) detailing of sensitivity and specificity; (3) use of a reference standard with diagnostic criteria prespecified; (4) presentation of original data, or original data could be obtained from the authors; and (5) publication in a language mastered by one of the authors (Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Likelihood ratios (LRs) of symptoms and signs of RCD or of a tear, compared with an acceptable reference standard; quality scores assigned using the Rational Clinical Examination score and bias evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies assessed the examination of referred patients by specialists. Only 5 studies reached Rational Clinical Examination quality scores of level 1-2. The studies with quality scores of level 1-2 included 30 to 203 shoulders with the prevalence of RCD ranging from 33% to 81%. Among pain provocation tests, a positive painful arc test result was the only finding with a positive LR greater than 2.0 for RCD (3.7 [95% CI, 1.9-7.0]), and a normal painful arc test result had the lowest negative LR (0.36 [95% CI, 0.23-0.54]). Among strength tests, a positive external rotation lag test (LR, 7.2 [95% CI, 1.7-31]) and internal rotation lag test (LR, 5.6 [95% CI, 2.6-12]) were the most accurate findings for full-thickness tears. A positive drop arm test result (LR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.0-11]) might help identify patients with RCD. A normal internal rotation lag test result was most accurate for identifying patients without a full-thickness tear (LR, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.0-0.58]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because specialists performed all the clinical maneuvers for RCD in each of the included studies with no finding evaluated in more than 3 studies, the generalizability of the results to a nonreferred population is unknown. A positive painful arc test result and a positive external rotation resistance test result were the most accurate findings for detecting RCD, whereas the presence of a positive lag test (external or internal rotation) result was most accurate for diagnosis of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear.","author":[{"family":"Hermans","given":"Job"},{"family":"Luime","given":"Jolanda J."},{"family":"Meuffels","given":"Duncan E."},{"family":"Reijman","given":"Max"},{"family":"Simel","given":"David L."},{"family":"Bierma-Zeinstra","given":"Sita M.A."}],"citation-key":"Hermans2013","container-title":"JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2013.276187","ISSN":"00987484","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"837-847","PMID":"23982370","title":"Does this patient with shoulder pain have rotator cuff disease?

  {"id":"Herre1987","abstract":"Ventricular arrhythmias generally result in a decrease in arterial pressure and increases in atrial and ventricular filling pressures which would be expected to induce reflex changes in efferent sympathetic nerve activity to the heart and peripheral circulation. Experiments were performed in 14 anesthetized dogs in order to 1) determine whether programmed ventricular stimulation produces changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity; 2) quantitate these changes; and 3) determine the cardiovascular reflexes that mediate these changes. Arterial and right atrial pressures and renal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded in dogs before and after administration of single and double programmed ventricular stimuli. In a group of 10 dogs after single extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 18 ± 2 mm Hg (mean ± SEM) while renal sympathetic nerve activity increased by 39 ± 15 impulses/s. These changes were directly related to degree of stimulus prematurity. After double extrastimuli, diastolic arterial pressure decreased by 22 ± 2 mm Hg whereas renal sympathetic activity increased by 55 ± 8 impulses/s. In an additional four dogs, double extrastimuli decreased arterial pressure (−34 ± 1 mm Hg) and increased cardiac (86 ± 16%) and renal (82 ± 12%) sympathetic traffic. After si-noaortic denervation, neither single nor double programmed ventricular stimuli resulted in alterations in cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity. It is concluded that the decreased arterial pressure caused by single and double programmed ventricular stimuli leads to increases in cardiac and renal sympathetic nerve activity that are mediated by sinoaortic baroreflexes. © 1987, American College of Cardiology.

  {"id":"Herring2008","abstract":"The co-transmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY), released during prolonged cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation, can attenuate vagal-induced bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that NPY reduces acetylcholine release, at similar concentrations to which it attenuates vagal bradycardia, via pre-synaptic Y2 receptors modulating a pathway that is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC). The Y2 receptor was immunofluorescently colocalized with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the guinea pig sinoatrial node. The effect of NPY in the presence of various enzyme inhibitors was then tested on the heart rate response to vagal nerve stimulation in isolated guinea pig sinoatrial node/right vagal nerve preparations and also on 3H-acetylcholine release from right atria during field stimulation. NPY reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation at 1, 3 and 5 Hz (significant at 100 nM and reaching a plateau at 250 nM NPY, p < 0.05, n = 6) but not to the stable analogue of acetylcholine, carbamylcholine (30, 60 or 90 nM, n = 6) which produced similar degrees of bradycardia. The reduced vagal response was abolished by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 (1 μM, n = 4). NPY also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine during field stimulation (250 nM, n = 6). The effect of NPY (250 nM) on vagal bradycardia was abolished by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C (0.1 μM, n = 5) and chelerythrine chloride (25 μM, n = 6) but not the PKA inhibitor H89 (0.5 μM, n = 6). Conversely, the PKC activator Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (0.5 μM, n = 7) mimicked the effect of NPY and significantly reduced 3H-acetylcholine release during field stimulation. These results show that NPY attenuates vagal bradycardia via a pre-synaptic decrease in acetylcholine release that appears to be mediated by a Y2 receptor pathway involving modulation of PKC. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"Herring2012","abstract":"The autonomic phenotype of congestive cardiac failure is characterised by high sympathetic drive and impaired vagal tone, which are independent predictors of mortality. We hypothesize that impaired bradycardia to peripheral vagal stimulation following high-level sympathetic drive is due to sympatho-vagal crosstalk by the adrenergic co-transmitters galanin and neuropeptide-Y (NPY). Moreover we hypothesize that galanin acts similarly to NPY by reducing vagal acetylcholine release via a receptor mediated, protein kinase-dependent pathway. Prolonged right stellate ganglion stimulation (10Hz, 2min, in the presence of 10μM metoprolol) in an isolated guinea pig atrial preparation with dual autonomic innervation leads to a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the magnitude of vagal bradycardia (5Hz) maintained over the subsequent 20min (n=6). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of galanin in a small number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons from freshly dissected stellate ganglion tissue sections. Following 3days of tissue culture however, most stellate neurons expressed galanin. Stellate stimulation caused the release of low levels of galanin and significantly higher levels of NPY into the surrounding perfusate (n=6, using ELISA). The reduction in vagal bradycardia post sympathetic stimulation was partially reversed by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 after 10min (1μM, n=5), and completely reversed with the NPY Y 2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 at all time points (1μM, n=6). Exogenous galanin (n=6, 50-500nM) also reduced the heart rate response to vagal stimulation but had no effect on the response to carbamylcholine that produced similar degrees of bradycardia (n=6). Galanin (500nM) also significantly attenuated the release of 3H-acetylcholine from isolated atria during field stimulation (5Hz, n=5). The effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia could be abolished by the galanin receptor antagonist M40 (n=5). Importantly the GalR 1 receptor was immunofluorescently co-localised with choline acetyl-transferase containing neurons at the sinoatrial node. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin (100nM, n=6) abolished the effect of galanin on vagal bradycardia whilst the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (500nM, n=6) had no effect. These results demonstrate that prolonged sympathetic activation releases the slowly diffusing adrenergic co-transmitter galanin in addition to NPY, and that this contributes to the attenuation in vagal bradycardia via a reduction in acetylcholine release. This effect is mediated by GalR 1 receptors on vagal neurons coupled to protein kinase C dependent signalling pathways. The role of galanin may become more important following an acute injury response where galanin expression is increased. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Herring","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Cranley","given":"James"},{"family":"Lokale","given":"Michael N"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Shanks","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Alston","given":"Eric N"},{"family":"Girard","given":"Beatrice M"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Parsons","given":"Rodney L"},{"family":"Habecker","given":"Beth A"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"David J"}],"citation-key":"Herring2012","container-title":"Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.11.016","ISSN":"00222828","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"667-676","title":"The cardiac sympathetic co-transmitter galanin reduces acetylcholine release and vagal bradycardia: Implications for neural control of cardiac excitability","type":"article-journal","volume":"52"},
  {"id":"Herring2015a","abstract":"Acute myocardial infarction and congestive cardiac failure are characterized by high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive. In these conditions, sympathetic neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can be released in addition to noradrenaline, and plasma levels correlate with infarct size and mortality. Even in the presence of β-blockers, NPY is able to bind to its own receptors located on cholinergic ganglia and ventricular myocytes. In this symposium report, I review the evidence that NPY can inhibit acetylcholine release during vagus nerve stimulation and limit the subsequent bradycardia. I also present preliminary, as yet unpublished data, demonstrating that NPY may be pro-arrhythmic by directly influencing ventricular electrophysiology. Targeting NPY receptors pharmacologically may therefore be a useful therapeutic strategy both to reduce heart rate and to prevent arrhythmias in the setting of myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. Such medications would be expected to act synergistically with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and implantable cardiac devices, such as defibrillators and vagus nerve stimulators.","author":[{"family":"Herring","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"Herring2015a","container-title":"Experimental Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/expphysiol.2014.080184","ISSN":"1469445X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,1]]},"page":"354-358","PMID":"25344273","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","title":"Autonomic control of the heart: Going beyond the classical neurotransmitters","type":"article-journal","volume":"100"},

Although Stage D HF has recently been defined as end-stage disease requiring special interventions for survival such as COSI or ventricular assist devices, concern has been raised regarding the safety, efficacy, mortality outcomes, and ethics of COSI. Methods and Results: Inotrope dependence was defined as worsening of the patient's clinical status with attempted inotrope withdrawal such that the patient was deemed unlikely to survive to permit hospital discharge. A care process for COSI was designed; baseline and outcome variables were evaluated. COSI was administered to 36 inotrope-dependent patients (age 55.4 ± 9.5 years, 24 males). Baseline characteristics (mean ± SD) were consistent with Stage D HF: left ventricular ejection fraction 19.9 ± 8.5, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) 70 ± 10 mm, systolic blood pressure 97.4 ± 13.4 mm Hg, serum creatinine 1.5 ± 0.6, serum sodium 131.7 ± 5.3; 69 HF hospitalizations (mean 1.9 ± 1.8) 6 months before COSI initiation. Symptomatic hypotension, increasing dyspnea, renal dysfunction, and hypoperfusion most commonly prevented inotrope withdrawal. Despite Stage D HF, patients were discharged with COSI ambulatory, oriented, and pain free. Rehospitalizations were 46; 6 subjects accounted for 24 hospitalizations; 23 had 0 or 1 rehospitalization. Median survival was 3.4 months (range 0.2.26.3 months); and 3-, 6-, and 12-month Kaplan Meier survival was 51%, 26%, and 6%, respectively.

Despite attempts to maximize adherence to and dosing of hydroxyurea, some patients continue to suffer from pain. Our institution developed a program to initiate chronic red blood cell transfusions for one year in patients clinically deemed to have high healthcare utilization from sickle cell pain, despite being prescribed hydroxyurea. Procedure: An institutional review board approved retrospective study to evaluate the health outcomes associated with a one-year red blood cell transfusion protocol in sickle cell patients experiencing recurrent pain events as compared with the health outcomes for these patients in the one year prior to receiving transfusion therapy. We performed a matched-pair analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank to determine the impact of transfusion therapy on clinic visits, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, hospitalization days, and opioid prescriptions filled. Results: One year of transfusion therapy significantly reduced the number of total emergency department visits for pain (6 vs 2.5 pain visits/year, P = 0.005), mean hospitalizations for pain (3.4 vs 0.9 pain admissions/year), and mean hospital days per year for pain crisis (23.5 vs 4.5, P = 0.0001), as compared with the one year prior to transfusion therapy.

  {"id":"Hirao1996","abstract":"Background: Differentiation between ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction over an accessory AV pathway (AP) and the AV node (AVN) may be difficult, especially in patients with a septal AP. Methods and Results: A new pacing method, para-Hisian pacing, was tested in 149 patients with AP and 53 patients without AP who had AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Ventricular pacing was performed adjacent to the His bundle and proximal right bundle branch (HB-RB), initially at high output to capture both RV and HB-RB. The output was then decreased to lose HB-RB capture. The change in timing and sequence of retrograde atrial activation between HB-RB capture and noncapture was examined. Loss of HB-RB capture without change in stimulus- atrial (S-A) interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AP conduction. An increase in S-A interval without change in His bundle-atrial interval or atrial activation sequence indicated exclusive retrograde AVN conduction. A change in atrial activation sequence indicated the presence of both retrograde AP and AVN conduction. Para-Hisian pacing correctly identified retrograde AP conduction in 132 of 147 AP patients, including all septal and right free wall APs. Retrograde AVN conduction masked AP conduction in 9 of 34 patients with a left free wall AP and 6 of 9 patients with the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Para-Hisian pacing correctly excluded AP conduction in all 53 patients with AVNRT. Conclusions: Para-Hisian pacing reliably identifies retrograde conduction over septal and right free wall APs, but AVN conduction may mask APs located far from the pacing site or with a long retrograde conduction time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirao","given":"Kenzo"},{"family":"Otomo","given":"Kenichiro"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xunzhang"},{"family":"Beckman","given":"Karen J."},{"family":"McClelland","given":"James H."},{"family":"Widman","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Mario D."},{"family":"Arruda","given":"Mauricio"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Lazzara","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Warren M."}],"citation-key":"Hirao1996","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.94.5.1027","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",9,1]]},"page":"1027-1035","PMID":"8790042","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Para-Hisian pacing: A new method for differentiating retrograde conduction over an accessory AV pathway from conduction over the AV node","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.94.5.1027","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Hoang2020","abstract":"The sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Many patients, however, experience VT despite maximal doses of beta blocker therapy, possibly due to the effects of sympathetic cotransmitters such as neuropeptide Y (NPY). The purpose of this study was to determine, in a porcine model, whether propranolol at doses higher than clinically recommended could block ventricular electrophysiological effects of sympathoexcitation via stellate ganglia stimulation, and if any residual effects are mediated by NPY. Greater release of cardiac NPY was observed at higher sympathetic stimulation frequencies (10 and 20 vs. 4 Hz). Despite treatment with even higher doses of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg), electrophysiological effects of sympathetic stimulation remained, with residual shortening of activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate of action potential duration (APD). Adjuvant treatment with the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO 3304, however, reduced these electrophysiological effects while augmenting inotropy. These data demonstrate that high-dose beta blocker therapy is insufficient to block electrophysiological effects of sympathoexcitation, and a portion of these electrical effects in vivo are mediated by NPY. Y1 receptor blockade may represent a promising adjuvant therapy to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.","author":[{"family":"Hoang","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Salavatian","given":"Siamak"},{"family":"Yamaguchi","given":"Naoko"},{"family":"Swid","given":"Mohammed Amer"},{"family":"Vaseghi","given":"Marmar"}],"citation-key":"Hoang2020","container-title":"JCI Insight","DOI":"10.1172/JCI.INSIGHT.135519","ISSN":"23793708","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,4]]},"PMID":"32493842","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","title":"Cardiac sympathetic activation circumvents high-dose beta blocker therapy in part through release of neuropeptide Y","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

An estimated 4463 (SE = 219) hospitalisations associated with NEC occurred among neonates in the United States during the year 2000, resulting in a hospitalisation rate of 109.9 [95% CI 97.2, 122.6] per 100 000 livebirths. The rate of NEC hospitalisations was highest among non-Hispanic Black neonates. The median hospital length of stay was 49 days. The in-hospital fatality rate was 15.2% (SE = 1.0%). Neonates who underwent a surgical procedure during hospitalisation were more likely to have a longer length of stay and to die than were those who did not have surgical intervention. Low-birthweight (LBW) neonates with NEC were more likely than LBW neonates hospitalised with other diagnoses to be very LBW (VLBW), non-Hispanic Black and male. In addition, compared with LBW neonates hospitalised with other diagnoses, LBW neonates with NEC had higher hospital charges and longer lengths of stay, and were more likely to die during hospitalisation. This study provides the first national estimate of the rate of hospitalisation for NEC among neonates in the United States.

The strongest predictors of AF progression were AF on the baseline ECG (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.73, p<0.0001) and increasing age (OR 1.16, 95% CI1.09 to 1.24, p<0.0001, per 10 increase), while patients with lower heart rate (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.89, p<0.0001, per 10 decrease ≤80) were less likely to progress. There was no significant interaction between rhythm on baseline ECG and heart rate (p=0.71). The HATCH and CHA₂DS₂VASc scores had modest discriminatory power for AF progression (C-indices 0.55 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.58) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.57)).\nCONCLUSIONS: Within 1.5 years, almost a quarter of the patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF progress to a more sustained form. Progression is strongly associated with heart rate, and age.","author":[{"family":"Holmqvist","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sunghee"},{"family":"Steinberg","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Reiffel","given":"James A."},{"family":"Mahaffey","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Gersh","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Fonarow","given":"Gregg C."},{"family":"Naccarelli","given":"Gerald V."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"James V."},{"family":"Kowey","given":"Peter R."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Laine"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Eric D."},{"family":"Piccini","given":"Jonathan P."},{"literal":"ORBIT-AF Investigators"}],"citation-key":"Holmqvist2015","container-title":"Heart (British Cardiac Society)","container-title-short":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/heartjnl-2014-307043","ISSN":"1468-201X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"894-899","PMCID":"PMC4453487","PMID":"25732748","source":"PubMed","title":"Heart rate is associated with progression of atrial fibrillation, independent of rhythm","type":"article-journal","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Hong2010","abstract":"The BAR domain protein superfamily is involved in membrane invagination and endocytosis, but its role in organizing membrane proteins has not been explored. In particular, the membrane scaffolding protein BIN1 functions to initiate T-tubule genesis in skeletal muscle cells. Constitutive knockdown of BIN1 in mice is perinatal lethal, which is associated with an induced dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the functional role of BIN1 in cardiomyocytes is not known. An important function of cardiac T-tubules is to allow L-type calcium channels (Cav1.2) to be in close proximity to sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors to initiate the intracellular calcium transient. Efficient excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and normal cardiac contractility depend upon Cav1.2 localization to T-tubules. We hypothesized that BIN1 not only exists at cardiac T-tubules, but it also localizes Cav1.2 to these membrane structures. We report that BIN1 localizes to cardiac T-tubules and clusters there with Cav1.2. Studies involve freshly acquired human and mouse adult cardiomyocytes using complementary immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy with dual immunogold labeling, and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we use surface biotinylation and live cell confocal and total internal fluorescence microscopy imaging in cardiomyocytes and cell lines to explore delivery of Cav1.2 to BIN1 structures. We find visually and quantitatively that dynamic microtubules are tethered to membrane scaffolded by BIN1, allowing targeted delivery of Cav1.2 from the microtubules to the associated membrane. Since Cav1.2 delivery to BIN1 occurs in reductionist non-myocyte cell lines, we find that other myocyte-specific structures are not essential and there is an intrinsic relationship between microtubule-based Cav1.2 delivery and its BIN1 scaffold. In differentiated mouse cardiomyocytes, knockdown of BIN1 reduces surface Cav1.2 and delays development of the calcium transient, indicating that Cav1.2 targeting to BIN1 is functionally important to cardiac calcium signaling. We have identified that membrane-associated BIN1 not only induces membrane curvature but can direct specific antegrade delivery of microtubule-transported membrane proteins. Furthermore, this paradigm provides a microtubule and BIN1-dependent mechanism of Cav1.2 delivery to T-tubules. This novel Cav1.2 trafficking pathway should serve as an important regulatory aspect of EC coupling, affecting cardiac contractility in mammalian hearts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Ting Ting"},{"family":"Smyth","given":"James W."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Danchen"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Kevin Y."},{"family":"Vogan","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Fong","given":"Tina S."},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Brian C."},{"family":"Colecraft","given":"Henry M."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Robin M."}],"citation-key":"Hong2010","container-title":"PLoS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","editor":[{"family":"Chien","given":"Kenneth R."}],"ISBN":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","ISSN":"15449173","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,16]]},"page":"e1000312","PMID":"20169111","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"BIN1 localizes the L-type calcium channel to cardiac T-tubules","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000312","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Hoover2009","abstract":"Dysfunction of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system is implicated in the genesis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention. © 2009 IBRO.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoover","given":"D.

  {"id":"Hopp2013","abstract":"High cardiac vagal control (as measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) is associated with lower depression. Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association. This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA. To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults. Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms. Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms. Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support. The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement. These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes.

  {"id":"Houle1999","abstract":"The low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum (0.06-0.10 Hz) is often used as an accurate reflection of sympathetic activity. Therefore, interventions that enhance cardiac sympathetic drive, e.g., exercise and myocardial ischemia, should elicit increases in the low-frequency power. Furthermore, because an enhanced sympathetic activation has been linked to an increased propensity for malignant arrhythmias, one might also predict a greater low-frequency power in animals that are susceptible to ventricular fibrillation than in resistant animals. To test these hypotheses, a 2-min coronary occlusion was made during the last minute of exercise in 71 dogs with healed myocardial infarctions: 43 had ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) and 28 did not experience arrhythmias (resistant). Exercise or ischemia alone provoked significant heart rate increases in both groups of animals, with the largest increase in the susceptible animals. These heart rate increases were attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Despite the sympathetically mediated increases in heart rate, the low-frequency power decreased, rather than increased, in both groups, with the largest decrease again in the susceptible animals: 4.0 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) in preexercise control and 2.2 +/- 0.2 (susceptible) vs. 2.9 +/- 0.2 ln ms2 (resistant) at highest exercise level. In a similar manner the parasympathetic antagonist atropine sulfate elicited significant reductions in the low-frequency power. Although sympathetic nerve activity was not directly recorded, these data suggest that the low-frequency component of the heart rate power spectrum probably results from an interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and, as such, does not accurately reflect changes in the sympathetic activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Houle","given":"Melanie S."},{"family":"Billman","given":"George E."}],"citation-key":"Houle1999","container-title":"American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.1.H215","ISBN":"0002-9513 (Print)\\r0002-9513 (Linking)","ISSN":"0363-6135","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",1]]},"page":"H215-H223","PMID":"9887035","title":"Low-frequency component of the heart rate variability spectrum: a poor marker of sympathetic activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajpheart.1999.276.1.H215","volume":"276"},

  {"id":"Hu2004","abstract":"There exists a robust day/night pattern in the incidence of adverse cardiac events with a peak at approximately 10 a.m. This peak traditionally has been attributed to day/night patterns in behaviors affecting cardiac function in vulnerable individuals. However, influences from the endogenous circadian pacemaker independent from behaviors may also affect cardiac control. Heartbeat dynamics under healthy conditions exhibit robust complex fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal structures, which break down under pathologic conditions. We hypothesize that these dynamical features of the healthy human heartbeat have an endogenous circadian rhythm that brings the features closer to those observed under pathologic conditions at the endogenous circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m. We investigate heartbeat dynamics in healthy subjects recorded throughout a 10-day protocol wherein the sleep/wake and behavior cycles are desynchronized from the endogenous circadian cycle, enabling assessment of circadian factors while controlling for behavior-related factors. We demonstrate that the scaling exponent characterizing temporal correlations in heartbeat dynamics does exhibit a significant circadian rhythm (with a sharp peak at the circadian phase corresponding to approximately 10 a.m.), which is independent from scheduled behaviors and mean heart rate. Cardiac dynamics under pathologic conditions such as congestive heart failure also are associated with a larger value of the scaling exponent of the interbeat interval. Thus, the sharp peak in the scaling exponent at the circadian phase coinciding with the period of highest cardiac vulnerability observed in epidemiological studies suggests that endogenous circadian-mediated influences on cardiac control may be involved in the day/night pattern of adverse cardiac events in vulnerable individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Ivanov","given":"Plamen Ch"},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Michael F"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Ayers","given":"R Timothy"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"H Eugene"},{"family":"Shea","given":"Steven A"}],"citation-key":"Hu2004","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0408243101","ISBN":"0027-8424","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"52","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",12,28]]},"page":"18223-7","PMID":"15611476","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","title":"Endogenous circadian rhythm in an index of cardiac vulnerability independent of changes in behavior.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15611476","volume":"101"},

This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorder and use of antidepressants with T-wave amplitude (TWA) and QT-interval. Methods: Data was obtained from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (n = 1,383). Depression/anxiety was diagnosed with the DSM-IV based Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was established. T-wave amplitude and QT-interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) were obtained from an ECG measured in a type II axis configuration. Results: Compared to controls, persons with depression or anxiety disorders did not show a significantly different TWA (p = 0.58; Cohen's d = 0.046) or QTc (p = 0.48; Cohen's d = -0.057). In spite of known sympathomimetic effects, TCA use (p = 0.26; Cohen's d = -0.162) and SNRI use (p = 0.70; Cohen's d = -0.055) were not significantly associated with a lower TWA. TCA use (p = 0.12; Cohen's d = 0.225) and SNRI use (p = 0.11; Cohen's d = 0.227) were also not significantly associated with a prolonged QTc.

  {"id":"Huang2018","abstract":"Importance Depressive symptoms are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic dysregulation, but the direction of the association remains unclear. Objective To investigate the temporal association between depression and HRV. Design, Settings, and Participants A longitudinal, cross-lagged twin difference study, with baseline assessments from March 2002 to March 2006 (visit 1) and a 7-year follow-up (visit 2) at an academic research center with participants recruited from a national twin registry. Twins (n = 166) from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, who served in the US military during the Vietnam War, and were discordant for depression at baseline were recruited. Main Outcomes and Measures At both visits, depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and HRV was measured through 24-hour electrocardiogram monitoring. To assess the direction of the association, within-pair differences in multivariable mixed-effects regression models were examined, and standardized β coefficients for both pathways were calculated. The associations were evaluated separately in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Results In the final analytic sample (N = 146), all participants were men, 138 (95%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 54 (3) years at baseline. Results showed consistent associations between visit 1 HRV and visit 2 BDI score across all HRV domains and models (β coefficients ranging from −0.14 to −0.29), which were not explained by antidepressants or other participant characteristics. The magnitude of the association was similar in the opposite pathway linking visit 1 BDI score to visit 2 HRV, with β coefficients ranging from 0.05 to −0.30, but it was largely explained by antidepressant use. In stratified analysis by zygosity, significant associations were observed in monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the path linking visit 1 HRV to visit 2 BDI score, although the associations were slightly stronger in dizygotic twins. Conclusions and Relevance The association between depression and autonomic dysregulation, indexed by HRV, is bidirectional, with stronger evidence suggesting that autonomic function affects depression risk rather than vice versa. The opposite causal pathway from depression to lower HRV is mostly driven by antidepressant use. These findings highlight an important role of autonomic nervous system in the risk of depression and contribute new understanding of the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Minxuan"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Su","given":"Shaoyong"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel J."},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy M."},{"family":"Shallenberger","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Huang2018a","abstract":"Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are spontaneous depolarizations during the repolarization phase of an action potential in cardiac myocytes. It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of I Ca,L and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in I Ca,L recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Xiaodong"},{"family":"Song","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Zhilin"}],"citation-key":"Huang2018a","container-title":"PLoS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006382","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"15537358","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"page":"e1006382","PMID":"30475801","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Determinants of early afterdepolarization properties in ventricular myocyte models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006382","volume":"14"},

METHODS: The Psychophysiological Investigation of Myocardial Ischemia (PIMI) was a large, multicenter study designed to assess psychological and physiological correlates of stress in patients with CAD. One hundred and eighty-eight patients with CAD as evidenced by at least 50% blockage of one major artery and a previous positive exercise stress test were included in this study. Patients included in this report were not taking beta blockers. Cardiovascular functioning was assessed by a modified Bruce protocol treadmill stress test. Measures of psychological functioning, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), were also obtained. RESULTS: BDI scores were negatively correlated with HR recovery (r = -0.15, p = .04). Depression scores accounted for 3.5% of the variance in HR recovery when controlling for participant age (p < .01). Depressive symptoms were related to two HRV indices (ultra-low frequency, high frequency). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are associated with cardiovascular autonomic nervous system dysfunction as assessed by HR recovery. This relationship is not merely due to an association of depression severity with beta blocker usage or a failure of depressed patients to achieve an adequate chronotropic response.","author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Joel W."},{"family":"York","given":"Kaki M."},{"family":"Li","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Sheps","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"Hughes2008","container-title":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/PSY.0b013e31816fcab3","ISBN":"0033-3174","ISSN":"15347796","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"456-460","PMID":"18434491","title":"Depressive symptoms predict heart rate recovery after exercise treadmill testing in patients with coronary artery disease: Results from the psychophysiological investigations of myocardial ischemia study","type":"article-journal","volume":"70"},

In addition, 120 medical students from UKM completed a slightly modified version of this questionnaire. Both the faculty and student questionnaires asked the respondent to identify the frequency of a given problem type. The faculty was also asked to estimate how difficult it was to evaluate a specific problem. In general, there was strong agreement among the North American and Malaysian faculty on the frequency and difficulty of the 24 types of problem students listed. There were some notable differences, such as Malaysian teachers perceiving the \"shy\" student more frequently than their North American counterparts who rated the student with deficits in knowledge more frequently. However, the overall similarity in the rankings suggest that clinical teachers face similar types of problems, independent of cultural differences and institutional differences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"D D"},{"family":"Khalid","given":"B A"},{"family":"Shahabudin","given":"S H"},{"family":"Rogayah","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Hunt1994","container-title":"Medical Journal of Malaysia","ISSN":"03005283","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",9]]},"page":"275-281","PMID":"7845279","title":"The problem student on clinical rotations: a comparison of Malaysian and North American views.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7845279","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"Hurst2005a","abstract":"The concept of the ventricular gradient was conceived in the mind of Frank Wilson in the early 1930s. Wilson, a mathematical genius, believed that the calculation of the ventricular gradient yielded information that was not otherwise obtainable. The method of analysis was not utilized by clinicians at large because the concept was not easy to understand and because the method used to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient was so time consuming that clinicians could not use it. Grant utilized the concept to create vector electrocardiography, but he believed that if his method of analysis was used, it was not often necessary to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. He did, however, describe an easy way to compute the direction of the ventricular gradient. The current major clinical use of the ventricular gradient is to identify primary and secondary T-wave abnormalities in an electrocardiogram showing left or right ventricular hypertrophy or left or right ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, the author uses the term ventricular time gradient instead of ventricular gradient in an effort to clarify the concept. Finally, the author discusses the possible clinical significance of a normally directed, but shorter than normal, ventricular time gradient, an attribute that has not been emphasized previously.","author":[{"family":"Hurst","given":"J.

  {"id":"Husser2009","abstract":"Background— Atrial fibrillation (AF) is heterogeneous at the clinical and molecular levels. Association studies have reported that common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in KCNE1 and SCN5A may predispose to AF. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that specific AF-associated genotypes confer variation on the appearance of AF assessed by analysis of fibrillatory rate of the atria.\n\nMethods and Results— Twenty-six nonrelated patients (21 males, mean age 55�12 years) with persistent lone AF (median AF duration 5 weeks) not taking class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs were studied. Fibrillatory rate was obtained by spatiotemporal QRST cancellation and time-frequency analysis of the index surface ECG. Genotypes at the AF-associated loci in KCNE1 (S38G) and SCN5A (H558R) were determined by direct DNA sequencing. The atrial fibrillatory rate was 418�50 fibrillations per minute (range, 336 to 521) in the study cohort. Carriers of the 38GG KCNE1 genotype (n=13) had significantly lower fibrillatory rates (392�36 versus 443�49 fibrillations per minute, P=0.006) compared to those with GS or SS genotype (n=13). Six patients (23%) with fibrillatory rates >450 fibrillations per minute, all had either the GS or SS genotype (χ2P=0.008). In contrast, both the heterozygeous and homozygeous SCN5A H558R polymorphism had no effect on fibrillatory rate. There were no significant associations between fibrillatory rate and clinical (age, gender, AF duration, drug treatment) or echocardiographic (left atrial diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction) variables. In multivariable regression analysis, the KCNE1 S38G genotype (SS/GS coded 0, GG coded 1) was the only independent predictor of fibrillatory rate (β=−0.437, P=0.006) with a SE of the estimate of 44 fibrillations per minute.\n\nConclusions— This study suggests that atrial fibrillatory rate obtained from the surface ECG is at least in part determined by KCNE1 (S38G) genotype, implying that this variant exerts functional effects on atrial electrophysiology. This intermediate ECG phenotype may be useful for elaborating genetic influences on AF mechanisms and identifying subsets of patients for variability in AF susceptibility or response to therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Husser","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Stridh","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Sörnmo","given":"Leif"},{"family":"Roden","given":"Dan M."},{"family":"Darbar","given":"Dawood"},{"family":"Bollmann","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"Husser2009","container-title":"Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCEP.108.799098","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2]]},"page":"24-28","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"A Genotype-Dependent Intermediate ECG Phenotype in Patients With Persistent Lone Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCEP.108.799098","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Hutchins1990","abstract":"Evaluation of regional myocardial blood flow by conventional scintigraphic techniques is limited to the qualitative assessment of regional tracer distribution. Dynamic imaging with positron emission tomography allows the quantitative delineation of myocardial tracer kinetics and, hence, the measurement of physiologic processes such as myocardial blood flow. To test this hypothesis, positron emission tomographic imaging in combination with N-13 ammonia was performed at rest and after pharmacologically induced vasodilation in seven healthy volunteers. Myocardial and blood time-activity curves derived from regions of interest over the heart and ventricular chamber were fitted using a three compartment model for N-13 ammonia, yielding rate constants for tracer uptake and retention. Myocardial blood flow (K1) averaged 88 ± 17 ml/min per 100 g at rest and increased to 417 ± 112 ml/min per 100 g after dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg) and handgrip exercise. The coronary reserve averaged 4.8 ± 1.3 and was not significantly different in the septal, anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. Blood flow values showed only a minor dependence on the correction for blood metabolites of N-13 ammonia. These data demonstrate that quantification of regional myocardial blood flow is feasible by dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging. The observed coronary flow reserve after dipyridamole is in close agreement with the results obtained by invasive techniques, indicating accurate flow estimates over a wide range. Thus, positron emission tomography may provide accurate and noninvasive definition of the functional significance of coronary artery disease and may allow the improved selection of patients for revascularization. © 1990.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hutchins","given":"Gary D."},{"family":"Schwaiger","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Rosenspire","given":"Karen C."},{"family":"Krivokapich","given":"Janine"},{"family":"Schelbert","given":"Heinrich"},{"family":"Kuhl","given":"David E."}],"citation-key":"Hutchins1990","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/0735-1097(90)90237-J","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"page":"1032-1042","PMID":"2312957","title":"Noninvasive quantification of regional blood flow in the human heart using N-13 ammonia and dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Individuals were categorised as having no diabetes, pre-diabetes or diabetes based on the 2010 American Diabetes Association criteria at study baseline (1990-2).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnoses of incident AF were obtained to the end of 2007. Associations between type 2 diabetes and markers of glucose homeostasis and the incidence of AF were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for possible confounders.\nRESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was associated with a significant increase in the risk of AF (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.60) after adjustment for confounders. There was no indication that individuals with pre-diabetes or those with undiagnosed diabetes were at increased risk of AF compared with those without diabetes. A positive linear association was observed between HbA1c and the risk of AF in those with and without diabetes (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20) and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15 per 1% point increase, respectively). There was no association between fasting glucose or insulin in those without diabetes, but a significant association with fasting glucose was found in those with the condition.

  {"id":"Hwang2017","abstract":"Objective Conduction disturbances are common in patients with aortic stenosis. We investigated the incidence, reversibility, and prognosis of conduction disorders requiring permanent pacemaker implantation in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis after isolated aortic valve replacement. Methods This was a retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care center. We evaluated the incidence of conduction disturbances in patients who underwent isolated surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis between January 2005 and May 2015. Relevant clinical information was obtained from the patients’ medical records. Results We reviewed results of 663 patients with pathologically proven degenerative aortic stenosis (bicuspid aortic valve, n = 285 [43.0%]) who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (mechanical valve, n = 310 [46.8%]). Patients’ mean age was 67.1 ± 8.1 years, and 362 were male (54.6%). Immediate postoperative intraventricular conduction disorders occurred in 56 patients (8.4%), and atrioventricular block occurred in 68 patients (10.3%). Ten patients with symptomatic second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block underwent permanent pacemaker implantation within 30 days of aortic valve replacement. During the mean follow-up period of 1288 ± 1122 days, 64 patients (9.7%) developed irreversible conduction disorders (bundle branch block n = 24 and first-degree atrioventricular block n = 42). Of the 10 patients requiring permanent pacemakers, 4 remained depend on the permanent pacemaker during follow-up. Beyond 30 days after aortic valve replacement, 1 patient underwent permanent pacemaker implantation for de novo conduction disturbance 44 months postoperatively. Conclusions After isolated aortic valve replacement, permanent pacemaker implantation for conduction disturbance is rare (n = 10/663, 1.5%). Isolated aortic valve replacement for degenerative aortic stenosis has a low risk of conduction disturbances during long-term follow-up.","author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"You Mi"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Ji Hyun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Minsu"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Jongmin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Joon Bum"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Sung Ho"},{"family":"Choo","given":"Suk Jung"},{"family":"Nam","given":"Gi Byoung"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Kee Joon"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Cheol Hyun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jae Won"},{"family":"Kim","given":"You Ho"}],"citation-key":"Hwang2017","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.05.101","ISSN":"1097685X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]},"page":"1556-1565.e1","PMID":"28712585","publisher":"Mosby Inc.","title":"Conduction disturbance after isolated surgical aortic valve replacement in degenerative aortic stenosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"154"},

  {"id":"Ibrahim2019","abstract":"A number of neurologic disorders can cause cardiac dysfunction by involving the conductive system and contractile apparatus of the heart. This is especially prominent in the neurocritical care setting where the spectrum of cardiac dysfunction due to acute neurologic injury ranges from trivial and isolated electrocardiographic changes to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death (Table 1). The mechanism of these cardiac complications is complex and not fully understood. An understanding of the neuroanatomical structures and pathways is of immense importance to comprehend the underlying pathophysiology that culminates as cardiac damage and dysregulation. Once the process is initiated, it can complicate and adversely affect the outcome of primary neurologic conditions commonly seen in the neurocritical care setting. Not only are these cardiac disorders under-recognized, there is a paucity of data to formulate evidence-based guidelines regarding early detection, acute management, and preventive strategies. However, certain details of clinical features and their course combined with location of primary neurologic lesion on neuroimaging and data obtained from laboratory investigations can be of great value to develop a strategy to appropriately manage these patients and to prevent adverse outcome from these cardiac complications. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction due to catastrophic neurologic conditions or due to stress of critical illness. We also address various clinical syndromes of cardiac dysfunction that occur as a result of the neurologic illness and in turn may complicate the course of the primary neurologic condition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Mohammad S."},{"family":"Samuel","given":"Bennson"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Wazim"},{"family":"Suchdev","given":"Kushak"}],"citation-key":"Ibrahim2019","container-title":"Neurocritical Care","DOI":"10.1007/s12028-018-0636-3","ISSN":"15560961","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,15]]},"page":"508-521","PMID":"30484009","publisher":"Humana Press Inc.","title":"Cardiac Dysfunction in Neurocritical Care: An Autonomic Perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0636-3","volume":"30"},

The review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines on select databases. Studies that examined the HRV-stress relationship via repeated measurements and validated psychometric instruments were included (n = 15). Participant numbers and ages ranged between 10 and 403 subjects and 18 and 60 years, respectively. Both experimental (n = 9) and real-life stress (n = 6) have been explored. While RMSSD was the most reported HRV metric (n = 10) significantly associated with stress, other metrics, including LF/HF (n = 7) and HF power (n = 6) were also reported. Various linear and nonlinear HRV metrics have been utilized, with nonlinear metrics used less often. The most frequently used psychometric instrument was the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (n = 10), though various other instruments have been reported.

  {"id":"Inoue1987","abstract":"Latex-induced transmural myocardial infarction or epicardial application of phenol interrupts sympathetic fibers innervating myocardium apical to the infarction or to the phenol-painted area. These denervated regions subsequently show supersensitive shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) in response to the infusion of norepinephrine (denervation supersensitivity). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that such denervation supersensitivity is arrhythmogenic. Ventricular arrhythmias were elicited by programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) during a control period, during bilateral stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (4 msec pulses, 4 Hz and 3 mA), and during the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 μg/kg/min). Study groups consisted of 14 sham-operated dogs, 16 dogs with phenol painted over a diagonal branch, 13 dogs with latex embolization of a diagonal branch that resulted in transmural myocardial infarction, 14 dogs with a one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch producing nontransmural myocardial infarction, and 12 dogs undergoing both phenol painting and one-stage ligation of a diagonal branch. Four to 22 days after the first operation, PVS was performed in anesthetized, open-chest dogs after neural decentralization of the heart. Dogs with phenol painting on the epicardium and dogs in which latex was injected into a diagonal branch showed supersensitive shortening of ERP to infused norepinephrine at apical sites. PVS resulted in ventricular fibrillation more often during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p < .001) and infusion of norepinephrine (p < .001) than during the control state in dogs treated with phenol alone. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was highest in dogs with ligation-induced infarction that received phenol compared with all other groups during control (p < .001), stimulation of the ansae subclaviae (p < .002), and the infusion of norepinephrine (p < .01). Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg or 10 mg iv at maximum) attenuated supersensitive shortening of ERP and decreased the incidence of induction of ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that (1) the canine heart with phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity, but without myocardial infarction, is more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during the infusion of norepinephrine compared with the control group, (2) the canine heart with latex-induced myocardial infarction shows sympathetic supersensitivity, but is not more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation during stimulation of the ansae subclaviae and infusion of norepinephrine, (3) phenol-induced sympathetic supersensitivity combined with nontransmural myocardial infarction makes the canine heart more vulnerable to PVS-induced ventricular fibrillation than any of the other study conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"H"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"D P"}],"citation-key":"Inoue1987","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.75.4.877","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987",4]]},"page":"877-887","PMID":"3829345","title":"Results of sympathetic denervation in the canine heart: Supersensitivity that may be arrhythmogenic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3829345","volume":"75"},

In eight dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation shortened ERP at all 45 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. After latex injection, ERP shortening was unchanged at all 15 basal sites but was eliminated (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) at three apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 14 of 30 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 13 apical sites, ERP shortening was not eliminated but attenuated significantly in 5-180 minutes. ERP shortening induced by infused norepinephrine (0.20-0.25 microgram/kg/min) did not differ between basal and apical test sites 3-4 hours after latex injection; that is, no supersensitivity occurred. Of six dogs with TMI produced by ligation of multiple coronary arteries without latex injection, ERP shortening induced by efferent sympathetic neural stimulation was eliminated at 10 apical sites in four dogs over a period of 3 hours. At 14 apical sites that did not show denervation in these six dogs, ERP shortening was unchanged. In seven dogs with latex-induced TMI, bilateral vagal stimulation lengthened ERP at all 40 apical and basal test sites before latex injection. Vagally induced ERP lengthening was unchanged at all 13 basal sites after latex injection. ERP lengthening was eliminated (less than or equal to 1 msec lengthening) at four of 27 apical sites in 5-20 minutes and at 13 apical sites 30-180 minutes after latex injection. At the remaining 10 apical sites, ERP lengthening was not eliminated but decreased significantly 3 hours after latex injection. Of nine dogs with ligation-induced NTMI, five dogs showed elimination of vagally induced ERP lengthening at eight apical sites in 3 hours after ligation. ERP lengthening induced by vagal stimulation was unchanged at all 17 basal sites in nine dogs with NTMI. We conclude that TMI produced by latex injection and ligation of multiple coronary arteries produces heterogeneous loss of efferent sympathetic innervation in noninfarcted apical sites as early as 5-20 minutes after coronary occlusion with more complete denervation occurring over time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"H"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"D P"}],"citation-key":"Inoue1988","container-title":"Circulation research","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",6]]},"page":"1111-20","PMID":"3383360","title":"Time course of denervation of efferent sympathetic and vagal nerves after occlusion of the coronary artery in the canine heart.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3383360","volume":"62"},
  {"id":"Inoue2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate relationships between the degree of early reperfusion achieved on perfusion-weighted imaging and clinical outcomes in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution studies. We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between the degree of reperfusion achieved and clinical outcomes in target mismatch (TMM) patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: The degree of reperfusion was calculated on the basis of the difference in perfusion-weighted imaging volumes (time to maximum of tissue residue function [Tmax]>6 s) between the baseline MRI and the early post-treatment follow-up scan. Patients were grouped into quartiles, on the basis of degree of reperfusion achieved, and the association between the degree of reperfusion and clinical outcomes in TMM and no TMM patients was assessed. Favorable clinical response was determined at day 30 on the basis of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at day 90.\\n\\nRESULTS: This study included 121 patients; 98 of these had TMM. The median degree of reperfusion achieved was not different in TMM patients (60%) versus No TMM patients (64%; P=0.604). The degree of reperfusion was strongly correlated with both favorable clinical response (P<0.001) and good functional outcome (P=0.001) in TMM patients; no correlation was present in no TMM. The frequency of achieving favorable clinical response or good functional outcome was significantly higher in TMM patients in the highest reperfusion quartile versus the lower 3 quartiles (88% versus 41% as odds ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-37.5; and 75% versus 34% as odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-16.7, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 90% as the optimal reperfusion threshold for predicting good functional outcomes.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: The degree of reperfusion documented on perfusion-weighted imaging after reperfusion therapies corresponds closely with clinical outcomes in TMM patients. Reperfusion of ≥90% of the perfusion lesion is an appropriate goal for reperfusion therapies to aspire to.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"Manabu"},{"family":"Mlynash","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Straka","given":"Matus"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Jovin","given":"Tudor G."},{"family":"Tipirneni","given":"Aaryani"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Marks","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Bammer","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Lansberg","given":"Maarten G."},{"family":"Albers","given":"Gregory W."}],"citation-key":"Inoue2013","container-title":"Stroke","DOI":"10.1161/STROKEAHA.111.000371","ISBN":"0039-2499","ISSN":"00392499","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,1]]},"page":"1885-1890","PMID":"23704106","title":"Clinical outcomes strongly associated with the degree of reperfusion achieved in target mismatch patients: Pooled data from the diffusion and perfusion imaging evaluation for understanding stroke evolution studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23704106","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"Inoue2017","abstract":"To determine the time course of afferent sympathetic and vagal denervation after coronary occlusion and that of neural recovery after reperfusion, we measured the vasopressor responses to bradykinin and the vasodepressor responses to nicotine applied in a felt pad to the left ventricular epicardium of open-chest dogs. Shortly after latex injection of a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied to the transmural ischemic area (n = 7) or apically to it (n = 6) was interrupted or attenuated. In contrast, nontransmural ischemia produced by ligation of the diagonal branch did not attenuate the response to bradykinin applied to the ischemic region (n = 6) or apically to it (n = 7). Transmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch of the LAD and a lateral marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery (n = 8) or by intraluminal balloon occlusion of the LAD (n = 7) decreased the vasopressor response to bradykinin applied within or apically to the ischemic area in < 13 min. The vasopressor response to bradykinin became attenuated when the myocardial blood flow in the epicardial test site decreased to ~ 40% or less of the control value. Nontransmural ischemia produced by occlusion of a diagonal branch (n = 7) attenuated the vasodepressor response to nicotine applied to the nonischemic area apically to the occlusion in < 13 min. A 15-min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion produced reversible attenuation of afferent neural responses. We conclude that ischemia interrupts afferent sympathetic and vagal cardiac reflex responses to bradykinin and nicotine and that these alterations are reversible after reperfusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"H."},{"family":"Skale","given":"B.

Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic variables were measured at baseline, during mental stress produced by Stroop’s color word conﬂict test and during epinephrine infusion at 2 rates (0.025 ␮mol/kg/min and 0.3 ␮mol/kg/min). Mental stress produced signiﬁcant effects on the electrophysiologic properties of the heart with shortening of all measured electrophysiologic variables except atrial, most markedly those of the sinus and the atrioventricular nodes. The effects on the right ventricular myocardium and the His-Purkinje conduction system were less pronounced. During infusion of epinephrine, corresponding effects could only be reproduced at a much higher plasma level.

  {"id":"ishrat2009","abstract":"Recent experimental evidence indicates that progesterone (PROG) protects against various models of brain injury, including ischemic stroke. Most human studies of pharmacologic treatments for acute cerebral stroke have failed despite initial success in animal models. To simulate better the typical human stroke without reperfusion, the present study was conducted to examine the efficacy of PROG on infarct volume and functional outcome in a permanent model of stroke, using direct cauterization of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Twenty-four male adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent pMCAO by electro-coagulation and sham operation. After induction of permanent MCA occlusion (pMCAO), the rats received an initial intraperitoneal injection of PROG (8 mg/kg) or vehicle at 1 h post-occlusion followed by subcutaneous injections at 6, 24 and 48 h. Functional deficits were tested on the rotarod and grip-strength meter at 24, 48 and 72 h after pMCAO. The rats were killed 72 h after surgery and isolated brain was sectioned into coronal slices and stained with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). PROG-treated rats showed a substantial reduction (54.05%) in the volume of the infarct (% contralateral hemisphere) compared to vehicle controls. In addition there was a significant improvement in ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod and increased grip strength observed in the pMCAO rats treated with PROG compared to vehicle. Taken together, these data indicate that PROG is beneficial in one of the best-characterized models of stroke, and may warrant further testing in future clinical trials for human stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ishrat","given":"Tauheed"},{"family":"Sayeed","given":"Iqbal"},{"family":"Atif","given":"Fahim"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Donald G"}],"citation-key":"ishrat2009","container-title":"Brain Research","container-title-short":"Brain Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.048","ISSN":"1872-6240","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2,27]]},"page":"94-101","PMID":"19135987","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Effects of progesterone administration on infarct volume and functional deficits following permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/19135987","volume":"1257"},

  {"id":"Iyer2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND: COPD is associated with significant morbidity primarily driven by acute exacerbations. Relative pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement, defined as a PA to ascending aorta (A) diameter ratio greater than one (PA:A>1) identifies patients at increased risk for exacerbations. However, little is known about the correlation between PA:A, echocardiography, and invasive hemodynamics in COPD.\\n\\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study of patients with severe COPD being evaluated for lung transplantation at a single center between 2007 and 2011 was conducted. Clinical characteristics, CT scans, echocardiograms, and right-sided heart catheterizations were reviewed. The PA diameter at the bifurcation and A diameter from the same CT image were measured. Linear and logistic regression were used to examine the relationships between PA:A ratio by CT scan and PA systolic pressure (PASP) by echocardiogram with invasive hemodynamics. Receiver operating characteristic analysis assessed the usefulness of the PA:A ratio and PASP in predicting resting pulmonary hypertension (PH) (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP]>25 mm Hg).\\n\\nRESULTS: Sixty patients with a mean predicted FEV1 of 27%±12% were evaluated. CT scan-measured PA:A correlated linearly with mPAP after adjustment for multiple covariates (r=0.30, P=.03), a finding not observed with PASP. In a multivariate logistic model, mPAP was independently associated with PA:A>1 (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.02-2.04; P=.04). PA:A>1 was 73% sensitive and 84% specific for identifying patients with resting PH (area under the curve, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.93; P<.001), whereas PASP was not useful.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A PA:A ratio>1 on CT scan outperforms echocardiography for diagnosing resting PH in patients with severe COPD.","author":[{"family":"Iyer","given":"Anand S."},{"family":"Wells","given":"J.

  {"id":"jack2010","abstract":"Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of A beta plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain beta-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF A beta(42) and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which A beta biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Jack","given":"CR"},{"family":"Knopman","given":"DS"},{"family":"Jagust","given":"WJ"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"LM"},{"family":"Aisen","given":"PS"},{"family":"Weiner","given":"MW"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"RC"},{"family":"Trojanowski","given":"JQ"}],"citation-key":"jack2010","container-title":"LANCET NEUROLOGY","ISSN":"1474-4422","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1]]},"page":"119-128","source":"ISI Web of Knowledge","title":"Hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers of the Alzheimer's pathological cascade","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://apps.isiknowledge.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/full_record.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&qid=1&SID=1CFeGhHpplj9ENlc1Ai&page=1&doc=1","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"James2017","abstract":"Problem/Condition: Rural communities often have worse health outcomes, have less access to care, and are less diverse than urban communities. Much of the research on rural health disparities examines disparities between rural and urban communities, with fewer studies on disparities within rural communities. This report provides an overview of racial/ethnic health disparities for selected indicators in rural areas of the United States. Reporting Period: 2012-2015. Description of System: Self-reported data from the 2012-2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were pooled to evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in health, access to care, and health-related behaviors among rural residents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using the National Center for Health Statistics 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties to assess rurality, this analysis focused on adults living in noncore (rural) counties. Results: Racial/ethnic minorities who lived in rural areas were younger (more often in the youngest age group) than non- Hispanic whites. Except for Asians and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (combined in the analysis), more racial/ ethnic minorities (compared with non-Hispanic whites) reported their health as fair or poor, that they had obesity, and that they were unable to see a physician in the past 12 months because of cost. All racial/ethnic minority populations were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to report having a personal health care provider. Non-Hispanic whites had the highest estimated prevalence of binge drinking in the past 30 days. Interpretation: Although persons in rural communities often have worse health outcomes and less access to health care than those in urban communities, rural racial/ethnic minority populations have substantial health, access to care, and lifestyle challenges that can be overlooked when considering aggregated population data. This study revealed difficulties among non-Hispanic whites as well, primarily related to health-related risk behaviors. Across each population, the challenges vary. Public Health Action: Stratifying data by different demographics, using community health needs assessments, and adopting and implementing the National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Standards can help rural communities identify disparities and develop effective initiatives to eliminate them, which aligns with a Healthy People 2020 overarching goal: achieving health equity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"James","given":"Cara V."},{"family":"Moonesinghe","given":"Ramal"},{"family":"Wilson-Frederick","given":"Shondelle M."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jeffrey E."},{"family":"Penman-Aguilar","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Bouye","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"James2017","container-title":"MMWR.

  {"id":"Jazrawi2017","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Although metabolic alkalosis is a common occurrence in intensive care units (ICUs), no study has evaluated its prevalence or outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients suffering from severe sepsis and septic shock admitted to the ICUs of Halmstad and Varberg County hospitals. From 910 patient records, 627 patients met the inclusion criteria. We investigated the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and mortality. Further, we studied the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and ICU length of stay (LOS). RESULTS Metabolic alkalosis was associated with decreased 30-day and 12-month mortalities. This effect was however lost when a multivariate analysis was conducted, correcting for age, gender, pH on admission, base excess (BE) on admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) and acute kidney injury (AKI). We then analyzed for any dose-response effect between the severity of metabolic alkalosis and mortality and found no relationship. Bivariate analysis showed that metabolic alkalosis had a significant effect on the length of ICU stay. When adjusting for age, sex, pH at admission, BE at admission, SAPS III and AKI in a multivariate analysis, metabolic alkalosis significantly contributed to prolonged ICU length of stay. In two separate sensitivity analyses pure metabolic alkalosis and late metabolic alkalosis (time of onset >48 hours) were the only significant predictor of increased ICU length of stay. CONCLUSION Metabolic alkalosis did not have any effect on 30-day and 12-month mortalities after adjusting for age, sex, SAPS III-score, pH and BE on admission and AKI in a multivariate analysis. The presence of metabolic alkalosis was independently associated with an increased ICU length of stay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jazrawi","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Baigi","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Chew","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"Jazrawi2017","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0168563","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-10","PMID":"28045915","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Alkalosis in Critically Ill Patients with Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28045915","volume":"doi:10.137"},

An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via \"sequential nephron blockade,\" first described more than 40 years ago. Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish safety and clinical efficacy. We summarize the existing literature evaluating the combination of loop and thiazide diuretics in patients with heart failure in order to describe the possible benefits and hazards associated with this therapy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema resolution, at the risk of inducing severe hypokalemia in addition to hyponatremia, hypotension, and worsening renal function. We provide considerations about prudent use of this therapy and review potential misconceptions about this long-used diuretic approach.

As such, standardized screening pathways for depression in patients with CVD offer the potential for early identification and optimal management of depression to improve health outcomes. Unfortunately, the burden of depression in patients with CVD is under-recognized; as a result, screening and management strategies targeting depression have been poorly implemented in patients with CVD.

  {"id":"Jia2018","abstract":"Heart failure and related morbidity and mortality are increasing at an alarming rate, in large part, because of increases in aging, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The clinical outcomes associated with heart failure are considerably worse for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes mellitus. In people with diabetes mellitus, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, has led to the descriptive terminology, diabetic cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy is increasing in parallel with the increase in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is initially characterized by myocardial fibrosis, dysfunctional remodeling, and associated diastolic dysfunction, later by systolic dysfunction, and eventually by clinical heart failure. Impaired cardiac insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, increases in oxidative stress, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, elevations in advanced glycation end products and collagen-based cardiomyocyte and extracellular matrix stiffness, impaired mitochondrial and cardiomyocyte calcium handling, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microvascular dysfunction, and a myriad of cardiac metabolic abnormalities have all been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Molecular mechanisms linked to the underlying pathophysiological changes include abnormalities in AMP-Activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-Activated receptors, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine, protein kinase C, microRNA, and exosome pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a contemporary view of these instigators of diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as mechanistically based strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Guanghong"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Sowers","given":"James R."}],"citation-key":"Jia2018","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.311586","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"624-638","PMID":"29449364","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Diabetic cardiomyopathy: An update of mechanisms contributing to this clinical entity","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

Digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms are often considered state-of-the-art for this purpose but require laborious rule readaptation for adapting to unseen morphologies. This work explores the adaptation of the the U-Net, a deep learning (DL) network employed for image segmentation, to electrocardiographic data. The model was trained using PhysioNet’s QT database, a small dataset of 105 2-lead ambulatory recordings, while being independently tested for many architectural variations, comprising changes in the model’s capacity (depth, width) and inference strategy (single- and multi-lead) in a fivefold cross-validation manner. This work features several regularization techniques to alleviate data scarcity, such as semi-supervised pre-training with low-quality data labels, performing ECG-based data augmentation and applying in-built model regularizers. The best performing configuration reached precisions of 90.12%, 99.14% and 98.25% and recalls of 98.73%, 99.94% and 99.88% for the P, QRS and T waves, respectively, on par with DSP-based approaches.

It is computationally the fastest, but there hasn't been a clear analysis of when its accuracy is adequate. In this paper, for a few factors we do calculations for a variety of mixed models to show patterns in the asymptotic bias of the estimator based on the maximum of the Laplace approximation of the log-likelihood. The biggest factor for asymptotic bias is the amount of discreteness in the response variable; there is more bias for binary and ordinal responses than for a count response, and more bias for a count response when its support is mainly near 0. When there is bias, the bias decreases as the cluster size increases. Often, the Laplace approximation is adequate even for small cluster sizes. Even with bias, the Laplace approximation may be adequate for quick assessment of competing mixed models with different random effects and covariates. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"joffe1999","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether use of the fetal fibronectin assay would decrease the number of admissions to labor and delivery for diagnosis and treatment of preterm labor.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort design was used to compare preterm labor admissions during a 12-month period of fetal fibronectin assay use (study) against a baseline period before fetal fibronectin assay was implemented as standard protocol. Patients coming to the physician's office or hospital with signs and symptoms of preterm labor had a sample obtained for fetal fibronectin assay per labeling criteria. Comparisons were made with the Mann-Whitney U test, independent Student t test, chi2 test, and Fisher exact test. P <.05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS: There was no difference noted in the number of deliveries between the baseline and study years. During the study year 251 of 330 patients evaluated for preterm labor met study criteria and had the fetal fibronectin assay completed. Eight patients did not have fetal fibronectin assay results available because of specimen handling errors, leaving 243 subjects available for study. Compared with the baseline year, the study year had significantly fewer admissions for preterm labor, preterm labor admissions per patient, and prescriptions written for tocolytic agents. In addition, the length of stay per admitted patient was significantly reduced. The study population had no differences in neonatal outcomes from the baseline population in terms of deliveries at <35.0 weeks' gestation, number of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, or days of ventilatory support per patient admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of the fetal fibronectin assay resulted in significantly reduced preterm labor admissions, length of stay, and prescriptions for tocolytic agents. No negative impact on neonatal outcomes was observed. Reductions in admissions for preterm labor and in charges per admission resulted in approximately $486,000 saved during the study period. A trend toward increased corticosteroid administration (for neonates ultimately admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit) was noted.","author":[{"family":"Joffe","given":"G.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) may produce ischemic preconditioning in people who have a subsequent stroke within days of an initial ischemic insult. We performed a cohort study of all 1707 patients given a diagnosis of TIA by an emergency department physician in 1 of 16 hospitals in a managed care plan in Northern California from March 1997 to February 1998. We evaluated the impact of the timing and duration of TIA on disability in a cohort of 180 patients with TIA and subsequent ischemic stroke within 90 days of the TIA. There was no association between duration of TIA, used as a surrogate for degree of ischemia, and likelihood of disability from a subsequent stroke. Furthermore, there was no difference in rates of disability among patients with strokes occurring within 1 day, 1 to <7 days, and 7 to 90 days after the TIA. We cannot confirm results of several other studies showing an association of prior TIA with lesser stroke severity. Whether differences in underlying pathophysiology and treatment of those with prior TIA could account for differences in outcome of subsequent strokes in prior studies is unknown. Evaluating whether ischemic preconditioning occurs after TIA is extremely difficult in observational studies in humans. Given the potential hazards of inducing therapeutic transient brain ischemia in humans, a trial may not be advisable, and proof may require testing of agents that safely mimic the effects of ischemia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"S Claiborne"}],"citation-key":"Johnston2004","container-title":"Stroke","DOI":"10.1161/01.STR.0000143322.20491.0f","ISBN":"0039-2499\\n1524-4628","ISSN":"00392499","issue":"11 SUPPL. 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"2680-2682","PMID":"15388902","title":"Ischemic preconditioning from transient ischemic attacks?

A Dyx ≤ 1.96 was associated with a significantly increased risk for malignant arrhythmias [hazards ratio (HR) = 4.36 (1.81–10.52), P = 0.001] and cardiovascular death [HR = 3.47 (1.38–8.74), P = 0.008]. Compared with important clinical risk parameters (age >70 years and QRS > 120 ms), Dyx ≤ 1.96 significantly added predictive value (P = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Dyx was a better predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias than the traditional measures of HRV and heart rate turbulence, particularly in the elderly. Dyx might be a useful tool for better selection of ICD candidates in the elderly population, since a normal Dyx in this group was associated with a very low risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

  {"id":"Jørgensen2016","abstract":"AIMS:The density HRV parameter Dyx is a new heart rate variability (HRV) measure based on multipole analysis of the Poincaré plot obtained from RR interval time series, deriving information from both the time and frequency domain. Preliminary results have suggested that the parameter may provide new predictive information on mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study compares the prognostic significance of Dyx to that of traditional linear and nonlinear measures of HRV.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS:In the Nordic ICD pilot study, patients with an acute MI were screened with 2D echocardiography and 24-hour Holter recordings. The study was designed to assess the power of several HRV measures to predict mortality. Dyx was tested in a subset of 206 consecutive Danish patients with analysable Holter recordings. After a median follow-up of 8.5 years 70 patients had died. Of all traditional and multipole HRV parameters, reduced Dyx was the most powerful predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 2.4; CI 1.5 to 3.8; P < 0.001). After adjustment for known risk markers, such as age, diabetes, ejection fraction, previous MI and hypertension, Dyx remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.02). Reduced Dyx also predicted cardiovascular death (P < 0.01) and sudden cardiovascular death (P = 0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, Dyx significantly predicted mortality in patients both with and without impaired left ventricular systolic function (P < 0.0001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION:The new nonlinear HRV measure Dyx is a promising independent predictor of mortality in a long-term follow-up study of patients surviving a MI, irrespectively of left ventricular systolic function.","author":[{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Rikke Mørch"},{"family":"Abildstrøm","given":"Steen Z"},{"family":"Levitan","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Kobo","given":"Roi"},{"family":"Puzanov","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Lewkowicz","given":"Meir"},{"family":"Huikuri","given":"Heikki"},{"family":"Peltola","given":"Mirja"},{"family":"Haarbo","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Poul Erik Bloch"},{"family":"Group","given":"Nordic I C D","dropping-particle":"pilot study"}],"citation-key":"Jørgensen2016","container-title":"Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc","DOI":"10.1111/anec.12297","ISSN":"1082720X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"60-68","title":"Heart Rate Variability Density Analysis (Dyx) and Prediction of Long-Term Mortality after Acute Myocardial Infarction.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anec.12297/full%5Cnpapers3://publication/doi/10.1111/anec.12297","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"Juhasz2014","abstract":"Galanin is a stress-inducible neuropeptide and cotransmitter in serotonin and norepinephrine neurons with a possible role in stress-related disorders. Here we report that variants in genes for galanin (GAL) and its receptors (GALR1, GALR2, GALR3), despite their disparate genomic loci, conferred increased risk of depression and anxiety in people who experienced childhood adversity or recent negative life events in a European white population cohort totaling 2,361 from Manchester, United Kingdom and Budapest, Hungary. Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed a greater relevance of galanin system genes in highly stressed subjects compared with subjects with moderate or low life stress. Using the same method, the effect of the galanin system genes was stronger than the effect of the well-studied 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Conventional multivariate analysis using general linear models demonstrated that interaction of galanin system genes with life stressors explained more variance (1.7%, P = 0.005) than the life stress-only model. This effect replicated in independent analysis of the Manchester and Budapest subpopulations, and in males and females. The results suggest that the galanin pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in humans by increasing the vulnerability to early and recent psychosocial stress. Correcting abnormal galanin function in depression could prove to be a novel target for drug development. The findings further emphasize the importance of modeling environmental interaction in finding new genes for depression.","author":[{"family":"Juhasz","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Hullam","given":"Gabor"},{"family":"Eszlari","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Gonda","given":"Xenia"},{"family":"Antal","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ian Muir"},{"family":"Hökfelt","given":"Tomas G.M."},{"family":"Deakin","given":"J.

  {"id":"Kadish2004","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy are at substantial risk for sudden death from cardiac causes. However, the value of prophylactic implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden death in such patients is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 458 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36 percent, and premature ventricular complexes or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A total of 229 patients were randomly assigned to receive standard medical therapy, and 229 to receive standard medical therapy plus a single-chamber ICD. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a mean (±SD) of 29.0±14.4 months. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 21 percent. The vast majority of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (86 percent) and beta-blockers (85 percent). There were 68 deaths: 28 in the ICD group, as compared with 40 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 1.06; P=0.08). The mortality rate at two years was 14.1 percent in the standard-therapy group (annual mortality rate, 7 percent) and 7.9 percent in the ICD group. There were 17 sudden deaths from arrhythmia: 3 in the ICD group, as compared with 14 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95 percentconfidence interval, 0.06 to 0.71; P=0.006).

Acute RV shock has an equally high mortality to left ventricular (LV) shock. Identification of RV involvement, particularly in the setting of hypotension, can help anticipate and prevent complications and has important management implications which are distinct from the management of patients presenting with LV infarction.

  {"id":"Kalla2020","abstract":"Aims ST-elevation myocardial infarction is associated with high levels of cardiac sympathetic drive and release of the cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY). We hypothesized that despite beta-blockade, NPY promotes arrhythmogenesis via ventricular myocyte receptors. Methods In 78 patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or and results fibrillation (VF) occurred in 6 (7.7%) within 48 h. These patients had significantly (P < 0.05) higher venous NPY levels despite the absence of classical risk factors including late presentation, larger infarct size, and beta-blocker usage. Receiver operating curve identified an NPY threshold of 27.3 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.71. RT-qPCR demonstrated the presence of NPY mRNA in both human and rat stellate ganglia. In the isolated Langendorff perfused rat heart, prolonged (10 Hz, 2 min) stimulation of the stellate ganglia caused significant NPY release. Despite maximal beta-blockade with metoprolol (10 lmol/L), optical mapping of ventricular voltage and calcium (using RH237 and Rhod2) demonstrated an increase in magnitude and shortening in duration of the calcium transient and a significant lowering of ventricular fibrillation threshold. These effects were prevented by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 (1 lmol/L). Neuropeptide Y (250 nmol/L) significantly increased the incidence of VT/VF (60% vs. 10%) during experimental ST-elevation ischaemia and reperfusion compared to control, and this could also be prevented by BIBO3304. Conclusions The co-transmitter NPY is released during sympathetic stimulation and acts as a novel arrhythmic trigger. Drugs inhibiting the Y1 receptor work synergistically with beta-blockade as a new anti-arrhythmic therapy.","author":[{"family":"Kalla","given":"Manish"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Guoliang"},{"family":"Tapoulal","given":"Nidi"},{"family":"Tomek","given":"Jakub"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Woodward","given":"Lavinia"},{"family":"Dall'Armellina","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Banning","given":"Adrian P."},{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Robin P."},{"family":"Neubauer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Kharbanda","given":"Rajesh K."},{"family":"Channon","given":"Keith M."},{"family":"Ajijola","given":"Olujimi A."},{"family":"Shivkumar","given":"Kalyanam"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"David J."},{"family":"Herring","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"Kalla2020","container-title":"European Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehz852","ISSN":"15229645","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"2168-2179","PMID":"31834357","title":"The cardiac sympathetic co-transmitter neuropeptide Y is pro-arrhythmic following ST-elevation myocardial infarction despite beta-blockade","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"Kalra2022","abstract":"Background\nFor patients with heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and iron deficiency, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose administration improves quality of life and exercise capacity in the short-term and reduces hospital admissions for heart failure up to 1 year. We aimed to evaluate the longer-term effects of intravenous ferric derisomaltose on cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure.\nMethods\nIRONMAN was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial done at 70 hospitals in the UK. Patients aged 18 years or older with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45%) and transferrin saturation less than 20% or serum ferritin less than 100 μg/L were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based system to intravenous ferric derisomaltose or usual care, stratified by recruitment context and trial site. The trial was open label, with masked adjudication of the outcomes. Intravenous ferric derisomaltose dose was determined by patient bodyweight and haemoglobin concentration. The primary outcome was recurrent hospital admissions for heart failure and cardiovascular death, assessed in all validly randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients assigned to ferric derisomaltose who received at least one infusion and all patients assigned to usual care. A COVID-19 sensitivity analysis censoring follow-up on Sept 30, 2020, was prespecified. IRONMAN is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02642562.\nFindings\nBetween Aug 25, 2016, and Oct 15, 2021, 1869 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 1137 were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ferric derisomaltose (n=569) or usual care (n=568). Median follow-up was 2·7 years (IQR 1·8–3·6). 336 primary endpoints (22·4 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric derisomaltose group and 411 (27·5 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the usual care group (rate ratio [RR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·66 to 1·02]; p=0·070). In the COVID-19 analysis, 210 primary endpoints (22·3 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric derisomaltose group compared with 280 (29·3 per 100 patient-years) in the usual care group (RR 0·76 [95% CI 0·58 to 1·00]; p=0·047). No between-group differences in deaths or hospitalisations due to infections were observed. Fewer patients in the ferric derisomaltose group had cardiac serious adverse events (200 [36%]) than in the usual care group (243 [43%]; difference –7·00% [95% CI –12·69 to –1·32]; p=0·016).\nInterpretation\nFor a broad range of patients with heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and iron deficiency, intravenous ferric derisomaltose administration was associated with a lower risk of hospital admissions for heart failure and cardiovascular death, further supporting the benefit of iron repletion in this population.\nFunding\nBritish Heart Foundation

  {"id":"Kapa2010","abstract":"The autonomic nervous system plays an integral role in the modulation of normal cardiac electrophysiology. This is achieved via a complex network of pre- and postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that synapse on extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac ganglia and ultimately directly innervate cardiac myocytes. Alterations in autonomic tone may induce changes in local cellular electrophysiology that may manifest clinically in a number of ways, ranging from changes in heart rate to changes in heart rhythm. These relationships between autonomic tone and the evolution of cardiac dysrhythmias are areas of evolving research, with increasing evidence for a key role for autonomic ganglia in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation and sympathetic nerves in the predilection toward ventricular tachycardia in areas of myocardial scar. In this review, we highlight what is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, the evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias, and a variety of mechanisms (eg, direct ion channel effects) and diagnostic tools that exist to help define this relationship. Further emphasized are potential future avenues of research needed to elucidate the relationship between changes in normal autonomic tone and the pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmias.","author":[{"family":"Kapa","given":"Suraj"},{"family":"Venkatachalam","given":"K.

  {"id":"Katritsis2010","abstract":"A trioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) represents the most common regular supraventricular arrhythmia in humans. 1 The precise anatomic site and nature of the pathways involved have not yet been established, and several attempts to provide a reasonable hypothesis based on anatomic or anisotropic models have been made. 2 There has been considerable evidence that the right and left inferior extensions of the human atrioventricular (AV) node and the atrionodal inputs they facilitate may provide the anatomic substrate of the slow pathway, and a comprehensive model of the tachycardia circuit for all forms of AVNRT based on the concept of atrionodal inputs has been proposed. 2 Still, however , the circuit of AVNRT remains elusive. Recently, time-honored conventional schemes for the diagnosis and classification of the various forms of the arrhythmia have been refuted in part by evolving evidence. Recognition of the various types of AVNRT is important, however, to expedite diagnosis and allow implementation of appropriate ablation therapy without complications. We present an update on AVNRT with a particular emphasis on electrophysiological criteria used for the differential diagnosis of regular, su-praventricular tachycardias. ECG Presentation Typically, AVNRT is a narrow-complex tachycardia, ie, QRS duration 120 ms, unless aberrant conduction, which is usually of the right bundle-branch type, or a previous conduction defect exists. Tachycardia-related ST depression and RR-interval variation may be seen. RR alternans in AVNRT has been attributed to the proposed model of a figure of 8 reentry with continuous crossing over of antegrade activation through an inferior input to the contralateral superior input via the node. 2 In the typical form of AVNRT (slow-fast), abnormal (retrograde) P waves are constantly related to the QRS and in the majority of cases are indiscernible or very close to the QRS complex (RP/RR 0.5). Thus, P waves are either masked by the QRS complex or seen as a small terminal P wave that is not present during sinus rhythm (Figure 1). In the atypical form of AVNRT (fast-slow), P waves are clearly visible before the QRS, ie, RP/PR 0.75 (Figure 2), denoting a \"long RP tachycardia,\" and are negative in leads II, III, aVF, and V 6 but positive in V 1. P waves are shallow in the inferior leads in the rare form of anterior fast-slow AVNRT. 3 Although AV dissociation is usually not seen, it can occur because neither the atria or the ventricles are necessary for the reentry circuit. If the tachycardia is initiated by atrial ectopic beats, the initial (ectopic) P wave usually differs from the subsequent (retrograde) P waves (Figure 1).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Katritsis","given":"Demosthenes G."},{"family":"Camm","given":"A.

  {"id":"Kaufmann2017","abstract":"Objective: To define the clinical features and biomarkers that predict which patients with pure autonomic failure will develop Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. Methods: One hundred patients who presented with pure autonomic failure were recruited at 5 medical centers in the United States. Seventy-four patients agreed to be followed prospectively. Patients underwent clinical evaluations including neurological rating scales, sleep questionnaires, smell test, and sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic function tests. Results: At enrollment, patients were 68 ± 12 years old (median ± interquartile range) and had had autonomic failure for 5 ± 7 years. Within 4 years of follow-up, 25 of 74 subjects (34%) developed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 13), Parkinson disease (n = 6), or multiple system atrophy (n = 6). The presence of probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder was strongly associated with the development of a manifest central nervous system (CNS) synucleinopathy (odds ratio = 7.1). Patients who phenoconverted to multiple system atrophy had younger age at onset of autonomic failure, severe bladder/bowel dysfunction, preserved olfaction, and a cardiac chronotropic response upon tilt > 10 beats per minute. Those who phenoconverted to Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies had decreased olfaction, a lesser chronotropic response to tilt, and a longer duration of illness. The small group of patients retaining the pure autonomic failure phenotype had very low plasma norepinephrine levels, slow resting heart rate, no REM sleep behavior disorder, and preserved smell. Interpretation: Patients presenting with pure autonomic failure are at high risk of phenoconverting to a manifest CNS synucleinopathy. Specific clinical features predict future diagnosis.

No specific feature in the history could be discerned which separated these patients from those with angina due to coronary heart disease.

The electrocardiogram demonstrated abnormalities in the ST-T waves in slightly over 50 per cent of the patients, and the postexercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in another 20 per cent. Objective evidence for myocardial ischemia (myocardial lactate production) was three times more frequent in women than in men. The frequency of carbohydrate and/or lipid abnormalities was approximately half that in patients with coronary heart disease and did not correlate with the presence of myocardial ischemia. Long-term follow-up of these patients indicated that over half showed gradual improvement without specific therapy, whereas only 8 per cent had an increase in chest pain.

Methods and Results: TW-Ad was measured from standard digital 12-lead ECG in 5618 adults (46% men; age, 50.9±12.5 years) participating in the Health 2000 Study - an epidemiological survey representative of the Finnish adult population. Independent replication was performed in 3831 participants of the KORA S4 Study (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg; 49% men; age, 48.7±13.7 years; mean follow-up, 8.8±1.1 years). During follow-up (7.7±1.4 years), 72 SCDs occurred in the Health 2000 Survey. Lower TW-Ad was univariately associated with SCD (0.32±0.36 versus 0.60±0.19; P<0.001); it had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.809. TW-Ad (≤0.46) conferred a hazard ratio of 10.8 (95% confidence interval, 6.8-17.4; P<0.001) for SCD; it remained independently predictive of SCD after multivariable adjustment for clinical risk markers (hazard ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-7.4; P<0.001). Replication analyses performed in the KORA S4 Study confirmed an increased risk for cardiac death (unadjusted hazard ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-9.5; P<0.001; multivariable adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5; P<0.05). Conclusion: Low TW-Ad, reflecting increased heterogeneity of repolarization, in standard 12-lead resting ECGs is a powerful and independent predictor of SCD in the adult general population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenttä","given":"Tuomas V."},{"family":"Sinner","given":"Moritz F."},{"family":"Nearing","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Freudling","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Porthan","given":"Kimmo"},{"family":"Tikkanen","given":"Jani T."},{"family":"Müller-Nurasyid","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Schramm","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Viitasalo","given":"Matti"},{"family":"Jula","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Nieminen","given":"Markku S."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Salomaa","given":"Veikko"},{"family":"Oikarinen","given":"Lasse"},{"family":"Verrier","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Kääb","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Junttila","given":"M.

  {"id":"Kerr2005","abstract":"Background\nAfter its initial diagnosis, atrial fibrillation (AF) may progress from paroxysmal to chronic AF (CAF). The rate of progression and risk factors for progression are not clearly defined.\nMethods\nThe Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (CARAF) enrolled patients from 6 Canadian cities at the time of their first electrocardiographic diagnosis of AF. Comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data were collected and patients were followed annually, carefully documenting clinical outcomes, recurrence of paroxysmal AF, and progression to CAF. Baseline clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables were evaluated by univariate Cox proportionate hazards analysis. A stepwise approach was used to model the association between echocardiographic and clinical variables with progression to CAF.\nResults\nA total of 757 patients with a baseline diagnosis of paroxysmal AF were evaluated. Median follow-up was 8.0 years (range 2 days to 11.1 years). The probability of progression to CAF by 1 year was 8.6% and thereafter there was a slow but steady progression to 24.7% by 5 years. By 5 years, the probability of documented recurrence of any AF (chronic or paroxysmal) was 63.2%. Increasing age, significant aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were independently associated with progression to CAF. A more rapid heart rate during AF was associated with decreased risk of progression.\nConclusions\nAfter the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal AF, there is a slow but steady progression to CAF. Baseline echocardiographic variables, age, cardiomyopathy, and heart rate were independently associated with progression to CAF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kerr","given":"Charles R."},{"family":"Humphries","given":"Karin H."},{"family":"Talajic","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Klein","given":"George J."},{"family":"Connolly","given":"Stuart J."},{"family":"Green","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Boone","given":"John"},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Dorian","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Newman","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Kerr2005","container-title":"American Heart Journal","container-title-short":"American Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.ahj.2004.09.053","ISSN":"0002-8703","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"489-496","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Progression to chronic atrial fibrillation after the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Results from the Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation","title-short":"Progression to chronic atrial fibrillation after the initial diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870304008129","volume":"149"},
  {"id":"Kerr2017","abstract":"Background Although time–domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) are used to estimate cardiac autonomic tone and disease risk in multiethnic populations, the genetic epidemiology of HRV in Hispanics/Latinos has not been characterized. Objective The purpose of this study was to conduct a genome-wide association study of heart rate (HR) and its variability in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and Women's Health Initiative Hispanic SNP-Health Association Resource project (n = 13,767). Methods We estimated HR (bpm), standard deviation of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (SDNN, ms), and root mean squared difference in successive, normal-to-normal interbeat intervals (RMSSD, ms) from resting, standard 12-lead ECGs. We estimated associations between each phenotype and 17 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accounting for relatedness and adjusting for age, sex, study site, and ancestry. Cohort-specific estimates were combined using fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis. We investigated replication for select SNPs exceeding genome-wide (P <5 × 10–8) or suggestive (P <10–6) significance thresholds. Results Two genome-wide significant SNPs replicated in a European ancestry cohort, 1 one for RMSSD (rs4963772; chromosome 12) and another for SDNN (rs12982903; chromosome 19). A suggestive SNP for HR (rs236352; chromosome 6) replicated in an African-American cohort. Functional annotation of replicated SNPs in cardiac and neuronal tissues identified potentially causal variants and mechanisms. Conclusion This first genome-wide association study of HRV and HR in Hispanics/Latinos underscores the potential for even modestly sized samples of non-European ancestry to inform the genetic epidemiology of complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kerr","given":"Kathleen F."},{"family":"Avery","given":"Christy L."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Henry J."},{"family":"Raffield","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qian S."},{"family":"Browning","given":"Brian L."},{"family":"Browning","given":"Sharon R."},{"family":"Conomos","given":"Matthew P."},{"family":"Gogarten","given":"Stephanie M."},{"family":"Laurie","given":"Cathy C."},{"family":"Sofer","given":"Tamar"},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Timothy A."},{"family":"Hohensee","given":"Chancellor"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Rebecca D."},{"family":"Kooperberg","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Méndez-Giráldez","given":"Raúl"},{"family":"Perez","given":"Marco V."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Reiner","given":"Alexander P."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhu Ming"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Sotoodehnia","given":"Nona"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Kent D."},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiuqing"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Leslie A."},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"James G."},{"family":"Rotter","given":"Jerome I."},{"family":"Heckbert","given":"Susan R."},{"family":"Jain","given":"Deepti"},{"family":"Whitsel","given":"Eric A."}],"citation-key":"Kerr2017","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.06.018","ISSN":"15563871","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]},"page":"1675-1684","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Genome-wide association study of heart rate and its variability in Hispanic/Latino cohorts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610988","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"kessler2001","abstract":"Background: Although recent research has shown that many people in the United States use complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies, little is known about time trends in use. Objective: To present data on time trends in CAM therapy use in the United States over the past half-century. Design: Nationally representative telephone survey of 2055 respondents that obtained information on current use, lifetime use, and age at first use for 20 CAM therapies. Setting: The 48 contiguous U.S. states. Participants: Household residents 18 years of age and older. Measurement: Retrospective self-reports of age at first use for each of 20 CAM therapies. Results: Previously reported analyses of these data showed that more than one third of the U.S. population was currently using CAM therapy in the year of the interview (1997). Subsequent analyses of lifetime use and age at onset showed that 67.6% of respondents had used at least one CAM therapy in their lifetime. Lifetime use steadily increased with age across three age cohorts: Approximately 3 of every 10 respondents in the pre-baby boom cohort, 5 of 10 in the baby boom cohort, and 7 of 10 in the post-baby boom cohort reported using some type of CAM therapy by age 33 years. Of respondents who ever used a CAM therapy, nearly half continued to use many years later. A wide range of individual CAM therapies increased in use over time, and the growth was similar across all major sociodemographic sectors of the study sample. Conclusions: Use of CAM therapies by a large proportion of the study sample is the result of a secular trend that began at least a half century ago. This trend suggests a continuing demand for CAM therapies that will affect health care delivery for the foreseeable future.","author":[{"family":"Kessler","given":"R.

  {"id":"Khan2017","abstract":"Mental stress-induced ischemia approximately doubles the risk of cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease, yet the mechanisms underlying changes in coronary blood flow in response to mental stress are poorly characterized. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates basal coronary blood flow in healthy humans and mediates mental stress-induced vasodilation in the forearm. However, its possible role in mental stress-induced increases in coronary blood flow is unknown. We studied 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age: 58 ± 14 yr) undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac catheterization and assessed the vasodilator response to mental stress elicited by the Stroop color-word test. Intracoronary substance P (20 pmol/min) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) were used to assess endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation, respectively. Coronary blood flow was estimated using intracoronary Doppler recordings and quantitative coronary angiography to measure coronary artery diameter. Mental stress increased coronary flow by 34 ± 7.0% over the preceding baseline during saline infusion (P < 0.01), and this was reduced to 26 ± 7.0% in the presence of the selective nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (0.625 µmol/min, P < 0.001). Mental stress increased coronary artery diameter by 6.9 ± 3.7% (P = 0.02) and 0.5 ± 2.8% (P = 0.51) in the presence of S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline. The response to substance P did not predict the response to mental stress (r(2) = -0.22, P = 0.83). nNOS mediates the human coronary vasodilator response to mental stress, predominantly through actions at the level of coronary resistance vessels.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute mental stress induces vasodilation of the coronary microvasculature.

  {"id":"Khanna2017a","abstract":"BACKGROUND Vasodilatory shock that does not respond to high-dose vasopressors is associated with high mortality. We investigated the effectiveness of angiotensin II for the treatment of patients with this condition. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with vasodilatory shock who were receiving more than 0.2 μg of norepinephrine per kilogram of body weight per minute or the equivalent dose of another vasopressor to receive infusions of either angiotensin II or placebo. The primary end point was a response with respect to mean arterial pressure at hour 3 after the start of infusion, with response defined as an increase from baseline of at least 10 mm Hg or an increase to at least 75 mm Hg, without an increase in the dose of background vasopressors. RESULTS A total of 344 patients were assigned to one of the two regimens; 321 received a study intervention (163 received angiotensin II, and 158 received placebo) and were included in the analysis. The primary end point was reached by more patients in the angiotensin II group (114 of 163 patients, 69.9%) than in the placebo group (37 of 158 patients, 23.4%) (odds ratio, 7.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.76 to 13.3; P<0.001). At 48 hours, the mean improvement in the cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (scores range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe dysfunction) was greater in the angiotensin II group than in the placebo group (-1.75 vs. -1.28, P = 0.01). Serious adverse events were reported in 60.7% of the patients in the angiotensin II group and in 67.1% in the placebo group. Death by day 28 occurred in 75 of 163 patients (46%) in the angiotensin II group and in 85 of 158 patients (54%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.07; P = 0.12).

Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2–5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases.

  {"id":"Kidwell2018","abstract":"There is a bidirectional relationship between affective disorders and cardiovascular abnormalities, often described as a downward spiral, whereas major depressive disorders (MDD, and anxiety disorders) significantly increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD); CVD are also associated with increased risk of developing MDD (and anxiety disorders). Moreover, the prognosis and progression of CVD is significantly worsened in the presence of MDD. Heart rate variability (HRV) has often been suggested as a potential mediator in this comorbidity. In this review, we discuss HRV alterations in MDD. However, we mainly focus on the direct relationship between HRV alterations and psychiatric symptoms, rather than its relationship with CVD, as this has been reviewed elsewhere. After a general introduction to HRV and how it can be measured, we review how HRV is altered in MDD. We subsequently describe how antidepressant drugs affect HRV, showing that some classes (such as tricyclics) generally worsen HRV, whereas others (most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have a more positive influence. We also review the effects of several other treatments, with a special focus on vagal nerve stimulation, finishing with some further considerations and recommendation for further research, both in humans and animals., Copyright (C) 2018 YEAR Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although she had successful lobectomy, she underwent several post operative complication including operation site bleeding, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atypical pneumonia. Her renal failure was prerenal type after massive operation site bleeding, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were started for renal replacement treatment. After 5 days of renal replacement therapy, her serum creatinine level was much improved from 2.7 mg/dL to 1.33 mg/dL. Cefepime renal dose were started, when atypical pneumonia became resistant to imipenem and vancomycin. After 5th day of cefepime use, the patient became stupor and developed one episode of brief generalized myoclonic seizure.

  {"id":"Kim2018","abstract":"Objective Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the ob-jective assessment of psychological health and stress.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Hye Geum"},{"family":"Cheon","given":"Eun Jin"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Dai Seg"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Young Hwan"},{"family":"Koo","given":"Bon Hoon"}],"citation-key":"Kim2018","container-title":"Psychiatry Investigation","DOI":"10.30773/pi.2017.08.17","ISSN":"19763026","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"page":"235-245","publisher":"Korean Neuropsychiatric Association","title":"Stress and heart rate variability: A meta-analysis and review of the literature","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE. Results Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3%]), 100% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5-9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.96;P = .03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8% vs 24.5% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51-1.33;P = .43), for cardiac death, 10.7% vs 13.2% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.41-1.52;P = .48); for MI, 8.7% vs 15.2% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-0.96;P = .04), and for PCI, 12.8% vs 19.9% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33-1.04;P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.

  {"id":"Kim2019","abstract":"RATIONALE: Excessive vasoconstriction in response to mental stress may be a potential mechanism by which acute psychological stress leads to adverse cardiac events. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether excessive digital vasoconstriction during acute mental stress predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred forty-nine patients with stable coronary artery disease (age 63±9, 76% male, 29% black) underwent mental stress testing with a standardized public speaking stressor and followed prospectively for cardiovascular end points. Digital pulse wave amplitude was continuously measured using peripheral artery tonometry (PAT, Itamar Inc). Stress/rest PAT ratio (sPAT) of pulse wave amplitude during mental stress/baseline was calculated and dichotomized by the median value into low and high sPAT ratio groups. Upon 3-year follow-up, Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard ratios were used to examine the association between sPAT ratio and the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and hospitalization for heart failure. The median sPAT ratio was 0.68 (interquartile range, 0.48-0.88), indicating 32% vasoconstriction with mental stress. Men were more likely to have low sPAT ratio than women (odds ratio, 1.79; P=0.007) while those on β-blockers were less likely to have low sPAT ratio (odds ratio, 0.52; P=0.003). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and rate-pressure product change during mental stress, those with low sPAT ratio were at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.12-2.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Greater peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, denoted by a low sPAT ratio, is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jeong Hwan"},{"family":"Almuwaqqat","given":"Zakaria"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chang"},{"family":"Ko","given":"Yi An"},{"family":"Lima","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Alkhoder","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Abdulbaki","given":"Rami"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

ET-GPs were mapped using high frequency stimulation, delivered within the atrial refractory period and ablated until nonfunctional. If triggered AF became incessant, atrioventricular dissociating GPs were ablated. We compared GP ablation (GPA) without pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) against PVI in patients with paroxysmal AF. Follow-up was for 12 months including 3-monthly 48-hour Holter monitors. The primary end point was documented ≥30 seconds of atrial arrhythmia after a 3-month blanking period.\nRESULTS: A total of 102 randomized patients were analyzed on a per-protocol basis after GPA (n = 52; 51%) or PVI (n = 50; 49%). Patients who underwent GPA had 89 ± 26 high frequency stimulation sites tested, identifying a median of 18.5% (interquartile range 16%-21%) of GPs. The radiofrequency ablation time was 22.9 ± 9.8 minutes in GPA and 38 ± 14.4 minutes in PVI (P < .0001). The freedom from ≥30 seconds of atrial arrhythmia at 12-month follow-up was 50% (26 of 52) with GPA vs 64% (32 of 50) with PVI (log-rank, P = .09). ET-GPA without atrioventricular dissociating GPA achieved 58% (22 of 38) freedom from the primary end point. There was a significantly higher reduction in antiarrhythmic drug usage postablation after GPA than after PVI (55.5% vs 36%; P = .05). Patients were referred for redo ablation procedures in 31% (16 of 52) after GPA and 24% (12 of 50) after PVI (P = .53).\nCONCLUSION: GPA did not prevent atrial arrhythmias more than PVI. However, less radiofrequency ablation was delivered to achieve a higher reduction in antiarrhythmic drug usage with GPA than with PVI.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Min-Young"},{"family":"Coyle","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Tomlinson","given":"David R."},{"family":"Sikkel","given":"Markus B."},{"family":"Sohaib","given":"Afzal"},{"family":"Luther","given":"Vishal"},{"family":"Leong","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Malcolme-Lawes","given":"Louisa"},{"family":"Low","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Sandler","given":"Belinda"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Elaine"},{"family":"Todd","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Fudge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Ian J."},{"family":"Koa-Wing","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ng","given":"Fu Siong"},{"family":"Qureshi","given":"Norman A."},{"family":"Whinnett","given":"Zachary I."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Nicholas S."},{"family":"Newcomb","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Cherith"},{"family":"Dhillon","given":"Gurpreet"},{"family":"Hunter","given":"Ross J."},{"family":"Lim","given":"Phang Boon"},{"family":"Linton","given":"Nicholas W.

  {"id":"Kingma2017","abstract":"Neural elements of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system transduce sensory inputs from the heart, blood vessels and other organs to ensure adequate cardiac function on a beat-to-beat basis. This inter-organ crosstalk is critical for normal function of the heart and other organs; derangements within the nervous system hierarchy contribute to pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. The role of intact cardiac nerves in development of, as well as protection against, ischemic injury is of current interest since it may involve recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. For instance, ischemic conditioning, a novel protection strategy against organ injury, and in particular remote conditioning, is likely mediated by activation of neural pathways or by endogenous cytoprotective blood-borne substances that stimulate different signalling pathways. This discovery reinforces the concept that inter-organ communication, and maintenance thereof, is key. As such, greater understanding of mechanisms and elucidation of treatment strategies is imperative to improve clinical outcomes particularly in patients with comorbidities. For instance, autonomic imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system regulation can initiate cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy that compromises cardiac stability and function. Neuromodulation therapies that directly target the intrinsic cardiac nervous system or other elements of the nervous system hierarchy are currently being investigated for treatment of different maladies in animal and human studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kingma","given":"John G"},{"family":"Simard","given":"Denys"},{"family":"Rouleau","given":"Jacques R"}],"citation-key":"Kingma2017","container-title":"World Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.4330/wjc.v9.i6.508","ISSN":"1949-8462","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"508","title":"Influence of cardiac nerve status on cardiovascular regulation and cardioprotection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.f6publishing.com","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Kirchhof2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND Despite improvements in the management of atrial fibrillation, patients with this condition remain at increased risk for cardiovascular complications. It is unclear whether early rhythm-control therapy can reduce this risk. METHODS In this international, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial, we randomly assigned patients who had early atrial fibrillation (diagnosed ≤1 year before enrollment) and cardiovascular conditions to receive either early rhythm control or usual care. Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year. The primary safety outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms and left ventricular function, were also evaluated. RESULTS In 135 centers, 2789 patients with early atrial fibrillation (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for efficacy at the third interim analysis after a median of 5.1 years of follow-up per patient. A first-primary-outcome event occurred in 249 of the patients assigned to early rhythm control (3.9 per 100 person-years) and in 316 patients assigned to usual care (5.0 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P = 0.005). The mean (±SD) number of nights spent in the hospital did not differ significantly between the groups (5.8±21.9 and 5.1±15.5 days per year, respectively; P = 0.23). The percentage of patients with a primary safety outcome event did not differ significantly between the groups; serious adverse events related to rhythm-control therapy occurred in 4.9% of the patients assigned to early rhythm control and 1.4% of the patients assigned to usual care. Symptoms and left ventricular function at 2 years did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Early rhythm-control therapy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes than usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions.

  {"id":"Kluge2021","abstract":"Sympathetic control of regional cardiac function occurs through postganglionic innervation from stellate ganglia and thoracic sympathetic chain. Whereas norepinephrine (NE) is their primary neurotransmitter, neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant cardiac cotransmitter. NPY plays a vital role in homeostatic processes including angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and cardiac remodeling. Elevated sympathetic stress, resulting in increased NE and NPY release, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias, which may result in sudden cardiac death. Current methods for the detection of NPY in myocardium are limited in their spatial and temporal resolution and take days to weeks to provide results [e.g., interstitial microdialysis with subsequent analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or mass spectrometry]. In this study, we report a novel approach for measurement of interstitial and intravascular NPY using a minimally invasive capacitive immunoprobe (C.I. probe). The first high-spatial and temporal resolution, multichannel measurements of NPY release in vivo are provided in both myocardium and transcardiac vascular space in a beating porcine heart. We provide NPY responses evoked by sympathetic stimulation and ectopic ventricular pacing and compare these to NE release and hemodynamic responses. We extend this approach to measure both NPY and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and show differential release profiles under sympathetic stimulation. Our data demonstrate rapid and local changes in neurotransmitter profiles in response to sympathetic cardiac stressors. Future implementations include real-time intraoperative determination of cardiac neuropeptides and deployment as a minimally invasive catheter.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The sympathetic nervous system regulates cardiac function through release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides within the myocardium. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acts as an acute cardiac vasoconstrictor and chronically to regulate angiogenesis and cardiac remodeling. Current methodologies for the measure of NPY are not capable of providing rapid readouts on a single-sample basis. Here we provide the first in vivo methodology to report dynamic, localized NPY levels within both myocardium and vascular compartments in a beating heart.","author":[{"family":"Kluge","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Dacey","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hadaya","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Shivkumar","given":"Kalyanam"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Shyue-An"},{"family":"Ardell","given":"Jeffrey L"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Corey"}],"citation-key":"Kluge2021","container-title":"American journal of physiology.

  {"id":"Koene2017","abstract":"Syncope is a clinical syndrome defined as a relatively brief self-limited transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow. Most often the trigger is an abrupt drop of systemic blood pressure. True syncope must be distinguished from other common non-syncope conditions in which real or apparent TLOC may occur such as seizures, concussions, or accidental falls. The causes of syncope are diverse, but in most instances, are relatively benign (e.g., reflex and orthostatic faints) with the main risks being accidents and/or injury. However, in some instances, syncope may be due to more worrisome conditions (particularly those associated with cardiac structural disease or channelopathies); in such circumstances, syncope may be an indicator of increased morbidity and mortality risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Establishing an accurate basis for the etiology of syncope is crucial in order to initiate effective therapy. In this review, we focus primarily on the causes of syncope that are associated with increased SCD risk (i.e., sudden arrhythmic cardiac death), and the management of these patients. In addition, we discuss the limitations of our understanding of SCD in relation to syncope, and propose future studies that may ultimately address how to improve outcomes of syncope patients and reduce SCD risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Koene","given":"Ryan J."},{"family":"Adkisson","given":"Wayne O."},{"family":"Benditt","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"Koene2017","container-title":"Journal of Arrhythmia","DOI":"10.1016/j.joa.2017.07.005","ISSN":"18832148","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"533-544","PMID":"29255498","title":"Syncope and the risk of sudden cardiac death: Evaluation, management, and prevention","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/j.joa.2017.07.005","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"kogler2015","abstract":"Stress is present in everyday life in various forms and situations. Two stressors frequently investigated are physiological and psychosocial stress. Besides similar subjective and hormonal responses, it has been suggested that they also share common neural substrates. The current study used activation-likelihood-estimation meta-analysis to test this assumption by integrating results of previous neuroimaging studies on stress processing. Reported results are cluster-level FWE corrected. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the anterior insula (AI) were the only regions that demonstrated overlapping activation for both stressors. Analysis of physiological stress showed consistent activation of cognitive and affective components of pain processing such as the insula, striatum, or the middle cingulate cortex. Contrarily, analysis across psychosocial stress revealed consistent activation of the right superior temporal gyrus and deactivation of the striatum. Notably, parts of the striatum appeared to be functionally specified: the dorsal striatum was activated in physiological stress, whereas the ventral striatum was deactivated in psychosocial stress. Additional functional connectivity and decoding analyses further characterized this functional heterogeneity and revealed higher associations of the dorsal striatum with motor regions and of the ventral striatum with reward processing. Based on our meta-analytic approach, activation of the IFG and the AI seems to indicate a global neural stress reaction. While physiological stress activates a motoric fight-or-flight reaction, during psychosocial stress attention is shifted towards emotion regulation and goal-directed behavior, and reward processing is reduced. Our results show the significance of differentiating physiological and psychosocial stress in neural engagement. Furthermore, the assessment of deactivations in addition to activations in stress research is highly recommended.","author":[{"family":"Kogler","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Veronika I"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Eickhoff","given":"Simon B"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Peter T"},{"family":"Gur","given":"Ruben C"},{"family":"Derntl","given":"Birgit"}],"citation-key":"kogler2015","container-title":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.06.059","ISSN":"10959572","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10]]},"page":"235-251","PMID":"26123376","publisher":"NIH Public Access","title":"Psychosocial versus physiological stress - Meta-analyses on deactivations and activations of the neural correlates of stress reactions","type":"article-journal","volume":"119"},

  {"id":"Kollia2017","abstract":"Objectives Although there is substantial evidence that psychological factors play an important role in the onset and course of cardiovascular disease (CVD), less is known about their combined effect and the pathways by which they affect cardiovascular health. The present work aimed to prospectively explore the effects of depression and anxiety on the 10-year CVD incidence, in relation to other lifestyle determinants, as linking factors in the context of the ATTICA study. Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002–2012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45 ± 13 years) and 400 women (aged 44 ± 18 years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as “Psychological distress”; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors. Results “Psychological distress” was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, “Psychological distress” mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: −7.1, 95% CI: −9.7, −4.5). Conclusions Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kollia","given":"Natasa"},{"family":"Panagiotakos","given":"Demosthenes"},{"family":"Georgousopoulou","given":"Ekavi"},{"family":"Chrysohoou","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Yannakoulia","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Stefanadis","given":"Christodoulos"},{"family":"Chatterji","given":"Somnath"},{"family":"Haro","given":"Josep Maria"},{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Charalabos"},{"family":"Pitsavos","given":"Christos"}],"citation-key":"Kollia2017","container-title":"Maturitas","DOI":"10.1016/j.maturitas.2017.09.005","ISBN":"2047-4873","ISSN":"18734111","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"73-79","PMID":"29150168","title":"Exploring the path between depression, anxiety and 10-year cardiovascular disease incidence, among apparently healthy Greek middle-aged adults: The ATTICA study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29150168","volume":"106"},

  {"id":"Konstam2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diverse causes of right-sided heart failure (RHF) include, among others, primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading caused by cardiac lesions associated with congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading resulting from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension from a variety of causes, including left-sided heart disease. Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF. METHODS: The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations. RESULTS: Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes. In this scientific statement, we review the causes and epidemiology of RV dysfunction and the pathophysiology of acute and chronic RHF and provide guidance for the management of the associated conditions leading to and caused by RHF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Konstam","given":"Marvin A."},{"family":"Kiernan","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bozkurt","given":"Biykem"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Kapur","given":"Navin K."},{"family":"Kociol","given":"Robb D."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Eldrin F."},{"family":"Mehra","given":"Mandeep R."},{"family":"Pagani","given":"Francis D."},{"family":"Raval","given":"Amish N."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Carey"}],"citation-key":"Konstam2018","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIR.0000000000000560","ISSN":"15244539","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,15]]},"page":"e578-e622","PMID":"29650544","publisher":"NLM (Medline)","title":"Evaluation and Management of Right-Sided Heart Failure: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://circ.ahajournals.org","volume":"137"},

  {"id":"Kotruchin2022","abstract":"Background: Adenosine has been recommended as a first-line treatment for stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Standard guidelines recommend 6-mg of adenosine administered intravenously (IV) with an immediate 20-ml IV bolus of normal saline solution (NSS; double syringe technique [DST]). However, a newly proposed single-syringe technique (SST), in which adenosine is diluted with an up to 20 ml IV bolus of NSS, was found to be beneficial. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the SST was noninferior to the DST for terminating stable SVT. Methods: A pilot multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted at nine hospitals in north and northeast Thailand. Thirty patients who were diagnosed with stable SVT were randomized into two groups of 15, with one receiving adenosine via the DST and the other via the SST. We examined SVT termination, the average successful dose, and the complication rate of each group. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Result: The termination rate was 93.3% in the DST and 100% in the SST group (p = 1.000), and the success rate of the first 6-mg dose of adenosine was 73.3% and 80%, respectively (p = 1.000). The total administered dose was 8.6 ± 5.1 mg in the DST group and 7.6 ± 4.5 mg in the SST group (p =.608). No complications were found in either group. Conclusions: The SST was non-inferior to the DST for termination of SVT. However, a further definitive study with a larger sample size is required.","author":[{"family":"Kotruchin","given":"Praew"},{"family":"Chaiyakhan","given":"Itchaya","dropping-particle":"on"},{"family":"Kamonsri","given":"Phimonphorn"},{"family":"Chantapoh","given":"Wittawin"},{"family":"Serewiwattana","given":"Nattapat"},{"family":"Kaweenattayanon","given":"Nayawadee"},{"family":"Narangsiya","given":"Nattacha"},{"family":"Lorcharassriwong","given":"Piyangkul"},{"family":"Korsakul","given":"Kittithat"},{"family":"Thawepornpuriphong","given":"Punnapat"},{"family":"Tirapuritorn","given":"Tanachoke"},{"family":"Mitsungnern","given":"Thapanawong"}],"citation-key":"Kotruchin2022","container-title":"Clinical Cardiology","DOI":"10.1002/clc.23820","ISSN":"19328737","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,27]]},"page":"583-589","PMID":"35340059","title":"Comparison between the double-syringe and the single-syringe techniques of adenosine administration for terminating supraventricular tachycardia: A pilot, randomized controlled trial","type":"article-journal","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"Kramer2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND Dog ownership has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3 837 005 participants (530 515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.69; I2, 0%). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31% risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.67-0.71; I2, 5.1%). CONCLUSIONS Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

The National Centre of Health Statistics estimated that IABP was used in 42 000 patients in the USA in 2002.

History Kantrowitz 1 described augmentation of coronary blood flow by retardation of the arterial pressure pulse in animal models in 1952. In 1958, Harken 2 suggested the removal of some of the blood volume via the femoral artery during systole and replacing it rapidly in diastole as a treatment for left ventricular (LV) failure, so called diastolic augmentation. Four years later, Moulopoulos and colleagues 3 developed an experimental prototype of an IABP whose inflation and deflation were timed to the cardiac cycle. In 1968, Kantrowitz 1 reported improved systemic arterial pressure and urine output with the use of an IABP in two subjects with cardio-genic shock, one of who survived to hospital dis-charge. Percutaneous IABs in sizes 8.5–9.5 French (rather than 15 French used earlier) were introduced in 1979, and shortly after this, Bergman and colleagues 4 described the first per-cutaneous insertion of IABP.

  {"id":"Kroenke2001","abstract":"OBJECTIVE While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as \"0\" (not at all) to \"3\" (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kroenke","given":"K"},{"family":"Spitzer","given":"R L"},{"family":"Williams","given":"J B"}],"citation-key":"Kroenke2001","container-title":"Journal of general internal medicine","ISSN":"0884-8734","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9]]},"page":"606-13","PMID":"11556941","title":"The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556941","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"Kronish2019","abstract":"Importance: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated depressive symptoms are at increased risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher health care costs. These observational findings prompted multiple scientific panels to advise universal depression screening in survivors of ACS prior to evidence from randomized screening trials. Objective: To determine whether systematically screening for depression in survivors of ACS improves quality of life and depression compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-group multisite randomized trial enrolled 1500 patients with ACS from 4 health care systems between November 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, with follow-up ending July 31, 2018. Patients were eligible if they had been hospitalized for ACS in the previous 2 to 12 months and had no prior history of depression. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Interventions: Patients with ACS were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive (1) systematic depression screening using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with notification of primary care clinicians and provision of centralized, patient-preference, stepped depression care for those with positive screening results (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10; screen, notify, and treat, n = 499); (2) systematic depression screening, with notification of primary care clinicians for those with positive screening results (screen and notify, n = 501); and (3) usual care (no screening, n = 500). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in quality-adjusted life-years. The secondary outcome was depression-free days. Adverse effects and mortality were assessed by patient interview and hospital records. Results: A total of 1500 patients (424 women and 1076 men; mean [SD] age, 65.9 [11.5] years) were randomized in the 18-month trial. Only 71 of 1000 eligible survivors of ACS (7.1%) had elevated 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores indicating depressive symptoms at screening. There were no differences in mean (SD) change in quality-adjusted life-years (screen, notify and treat, -0.06 [0.20]; screen and notify, -0.06 [0.20]; no screen, -0.06 [0.18]; P =.98) or cumulative mean (SD) depression-free days (screen, notify and treat, 343.1 [179.0] days; screen and notify, 351.3 [175.0] days; no screen, 339.0 [176.6] days; P =.63). Harms including death, bleeding, or sleep difficulties did not differ among groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with ACS without a history of depression, systematic depression screening with or without providing depression treatment did not alter quality-adjusted life-years, depression-free days, or harms.

  {"id":"Krygier2013","abstract":"Mindfulness meditation has beneficial effects on brain and body, yet the impact of Vipassana, a type of mindfulness meditation, on heart rate variability (HRV) - a psychophysiological marker of mental and physical health - is unknown. We hypothesised increases in measures of well-being and HRV, and decreases in ill-being after training in Vipassana compared to before (time effects), during the meditation task compared to resting baseline (task effects), and a time by task interaction with more pronounced differences between tasks after Vipassana training. HRV (5-minute resting baseline vs. 5-minute meditation) was collected from 36 participants before and after they completed a 10-day intensive Vipassana retreat.

These measures were: normalised high-frequency power (HF n.u.), a widely used biomarker of parasympathetic activity; log-transformed high frequency power (ln HF), a measure of RSA and required to interpret normalised HF; and Traube-Hering-Mayer waves (THM), a component of the low frequency spectrum linked to baroreflex outflow.

Further testing revealed that pre-Vipassana only ln HF increased during meditation (vs. resting baseline), consistent with a change in respiration. Post-Vipassana, the meditation task increased HF n.u. and decreased THM compared to resting baseline, suggesting post-Vipassana task-related changes are characterised by a decrease in absolute LF power, not parasympathetic-mediated increases in HF power. Such baroreflex changes are classically associated with attentional load, and our results are interpreted in light of the concept of 'flow' - a state of positive and full immersion in an activity.

  {"id":"Kuck2000","abstract":"Background - We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized comparison of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy in survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to documented ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and Results - From 1987, eligible patients were randomized to an ICD, amiodarone, propafenone, or metoprolol (ICD versus antiarrhythmic agents randomization ratio 1:3). Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March 1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61% higher all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3 months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57±34 months, the crude death rates were 36.4% (95% CI 26.9% to 46.6%) in the ICD and 44.4% (95% CI 37.2% to 51.8%) in the amiodarone/metoprolol arm. Overall survival was higher, though not significantly, in patients assigned to ICD than in those assigned to drug therapy (1-sided P=0.081, hazard ratio 0.766, [97.5% CI upper bound 1.112]). In ICD patients, the percent reductions in all-cause mortality were 41.9%, 39.3%, 28.4%, 27.7%, 22.8%, 11.4%, 9.1%, 10.6%, and 24.7% at years 1 to 9 of follow-up. Conclusions - During long-term follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors, therapy with an ICD is associated with a 23% (nonsignificant) reduction of all-cause mortality rates when compared with treatment with amiodarone/metoprolol. The benefit of ICD therapy is more evident during the first 5 years after the index event.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuck","given":"Karl Heinz"},{"family":"Cappato","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Siebels","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Rüppel","given":"Rudolf"}],"citation-key":"Kuck2000","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.102.7.748","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"748-754","PMID":"10942742","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic drug therapy with implantable defibrillators in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest: The cardiac arrest study hamburg (CASH)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10942742/","volume":"102"},

We hypothesized that increased HIV-RNA levels following ART interruption induced activation of tissue factor pathways, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis. Methods and Findings Stored samples were used to measure six biomarkers: high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), amyloid A, amyloid P, D-dimer, and prothrombin fragment 1þ2. Two studies were conducted: (1) a nested case-control study for studying biomarker associations with mortality, and (2) a study to compare DC and VS participants for biomarker changes. For (1), markers were determined at study entry and before death (latest level) for 85 deaths and for two controls (n ¼ 170) matched on country, age, sex, and date of randomization. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with logistic regression. For each biomarker, each of the three upper quartiles was compared to the lowest quartile. For (2), the biomarkers were assessed for 249 DC and 250 VS participants at study entry and 1 mo following randomization. Higher levels of hsCRP, IL-6, and D-dimer at study entry were significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Unadjusted ORs (highest versus lowest quartile) were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-4.1; p ¼ 0.05), 8.3 (95% CI, 3.3-20.8; p , 0.0001), and 12.4 (95% CI, 4.2-37.0; p , 0.0001), respectively. Associations were significant after adjustment, when the DC and VS groups were analyzed separately, and when latest levels were assessed. IL-6 and D-dimer increased at 1 mo by 30% and 16% in the DC group and by 0% and 5% in the VS group (p , 0.0001 for treatment difference for both biomarkers); increases in the DC group were related to HIV-RNA levels at 1 mo (p , 0.0001). In an expanded case-control analysis (four controls per case), the OR (DC/VS) for mortality was reduced from 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.1; p ¼ 0.02) to 1.5 (95% CI, 0.8-2.8) and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8-2.5) after adjustment for latest levels of IL-6 and D-dimer, respectively. Conclusions IL-6 and D-dimer were strongly related to all-cause mortality. Interrupting ART may further increase the risk of death by raising IL-6 and D-dimer levels. Therapies that reduce the inflammatory response to HIV and decrease IL-6 and D-dimer levels may warrant investigation.

The diagnosis of STEMI is based on clinical characteristics and persistent ST-segment elevation as demonstrated by 12-lead electrocardiography. Patients with STEMI should undergo rapid assessment for reperfusion therapy, and a reperfusion strategy should be implemented promptly after the patient's contact with the health care system. Two methods are currently available for establishing timely coronary reperfusion: primary percutaneous coronary intervention and fibrinolytic therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred method but is not always available. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are critical adjuncts to reperfusion.

Methods: Patients with systolic HF (N= 100, 26% female, mean 65 ± 12 years of age) underwent a structured public speech task, during which BP and heart rate were recorded. Stress-induced BP and heart rate reactivity were categorized as high (>75%), intermediate (25% to 75%), or low (<25%). Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the predictive value of cardiovascular stress responses for mortality (median follow-up= 48.5 months), adjusting for age, implanted devices, and baseline BP and heart rate levels. Results: At follow-up, 31 patients had died (31%). Mortality rates were 2 times higher (hazard ratio [HR]:2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 3.60; p= 0.014) among patients with the lowest diastolic BP responses (mean=-2.4 ± 5.4mmHg) to mental stress than among those patients with an intermediate diastolic BP response (mean= 7.3 ± 2.5mmHg), adjusting for covariates. High diastolic BP reactivity (mean= 16.3 ± 3.4 mmHg) was not related to mortality (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.66). Systolic BP responses showed a similar but nonsignificant association. Multivariate analyses showed that a high heart rate response (>6.3 beats/min) to acute mental stress was associated with a reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.16 to 1.00; p= 0.051) compared to patients with intermediate responses. Conclusions: Low diastolic BP reactivity to mental stress is independently associated with all-cause mortality inpatients with HF. Larger studies need to replicate this finding and examine the role of psychosocial variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kupper","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Denollet","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Widdershoven","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Kop","given":"Willem J."}],"citation-key":"Kupper2015","container-title":"JACC: Heart Failure","DOI":"10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016","ISSN":"22131779","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,1]]},"page":"373-382","PMID":"25951757","publisher":"American College of Cardiology FoundationWashington, D.C.","title":"Cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress and mortality in patients with heart failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jchf.2014.12.016","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"Kurup2006a","abstract":"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity disease initiated by inhalation and subsequent sensitisation to organic antigens. These diseases have been described in different occupational groups and present in acute, subacute or chronic forms based on the exposure to antigens and host response. Clinical features are dependent upon the stage of the disease and can include fever, chills, cough, dyspnoea, and weight loss. The immunopathogenesis involves both cellular immunity and antibody responses to inhaled antigens. Antibody response to the implicated antigen can be demonstrated in HP patients, but such antibodies are also detected in antigen exposed asymptomatic individuals. Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrates lymphocytosis and preponderance of CD8+ cells. Pulmonary function studies demonstrate a restrictive pattern with diffusion defects. The diagnosis is difficult as no single test is confirmatory, hence information from clinical, radiological, physiological, and immunological evaluations may be used together for a confirmative diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The treatment of choice is avoidance of antigen but systemic corticosteroids may be effective in suppressing the inflammatory response. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and effective antigen avoidance.","author":[{"family":"Kurup","given":"Viswanath P."},{"family":"Zacharisen","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Fink","given":"Jordan N."}],"citation-key":"Kurup2006a","container-title":"The Indian journal of chest diseases & allied sciences","ISSN":"03779343","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"115-128","title":"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis.","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"Kwaku2002","abstract":"Typical atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia among adults, and accounts for considerable morbidity. The concept of dual pathway physiology remains useful, although this physiology likely results from the functional properties of anisotropic tissue within the triangle of Koch, rather than anatomically distinct tracts of conduction. Also, there remains debate regarding whether the critical reentrant circuit path requires participation of the atrium. In our opinion, current evidence favors functional anisotropic reentry limited to the subatrial tissues as the arrhythmia mechanism. Reasons for this are reviewed. Fortunately, typical AVNRT is readily amenable to definitive therapy by catheter-based radiofrequency energy delivery at the so-called slow pathway region located at the posterior Triangle of Koch. Anterior or left-sided approaches are very rarely indicated. Results from multiple series have shown this strategy to be both safe and effective, therefore ablation therapy should now be considered as the definitive therapy of choice for the majority of patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwaku","given":"Kevin F."},{"family":"Josephson","given":"Mark E."}],"citation-key":"Kwaku2002","container-title":"Cardiac Electrophysiology Review","DOI":"10.1023/A:1021140509804","ISSN":"13852264","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",12]]},"page":"414-421","PMID":"12438822","publisher":"Springer","title":"Typical AVNRT - An update on mechanisms and therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021140509804","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Kwon2018b","abstract":"Objectives: Heart rate variability (HRV) has gained recognition as a noninvasive marker of autonomic activity. HRV is considered a promising tool in various clinical scenarios. The optimal electrocardiogram (ECG) sampling frequency required to ensure sufficient precision of R–R intervals for HRV analysis has not yet been determined. Here, we aimed to determine the acceptable ECG sampling frequency range by analyzing ECG signals from patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute intoxication or overdose. Methods: The study included 83 adult patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute poisoning. The original 1,000-Hz ECG signals were down-sampled to 500-, 250-, 100-, and 50-Hz sampling frequencies with linear interpolation. R–R interval data were analyzed for time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters. Parameters derived from the data on down-sampled frequencies were compared with those derived from the data on 1,000-Hz signals, and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and Poincaré plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time-and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors. Conclusions: A 250-Hz sampling frequency would be acceptable for HRV analysis. When frequency-domain analysis is not required, a 100-Hz sampling frequency would also be acceptable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwon","given":"Ohhwan"},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Jinwoo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyung Bin"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"In Ho"},{"family":"Park","given":"Song Yi"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ji Eun"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yuri"}],"citation-key":"Kwon2018b","container-title":"Healthcare Informatics Research","DOI":"10.4258/hir.2018.24.3.198","ISSN":"2093369X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"198-206","title":"Electrocardiogram sampling frequency range acceptable for heart rate variability analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.e-hir.org","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"Kyrou2017","abstract":"Background Chronic stress frequently manifests with anxiety and/or depressive symptomatology and may have detrimental cardiometabolic effects over time. As such, recognising the potential links between stress-related psychological disorders and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is becoming increasingly important in cardiovascular epidemiology research. The primary aim of this study was to explore prospectively potential associations between clinically relevant depressive symptomatology and anxiety levels and the 10-year CVD incidence among apparently healthy Greek adults. Design A population-based, health and nutrition prospective survey. Methods In the context of the ATTICA Study (2002-2012), 853 adult participants without previous CVD history (453 men (45+/-13 years) and 400 women (44+/-18 years)) underwent psychological evaluations through validated, self-reporting depression and anxiety questionnaires. Results After adjustment for multiple established CVD risk factors, both reported depression and anxiety levels were positively and independently associated with the 10-year CVD incidence, with depression markedly increasing the CVD risk by approximately fourfold (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.6 (1.3, 11) for depression status; 1.03 (1.0, 1.1) for anxiety levels). Conclusions Our findings indicate that standardised psychological assessments focusing on depression and anxiety should be considered as an additional and distinct aspect in the context of CVD preventive strategies that are designed and implemented by health authorities at the general population level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kyrou","given":"Ioannis"},{"family":"Kollia","given":"Natasa"},{"family":"Panagiotakos","given":"Demosthenes"},{"family":"Georgousopoulou","given":"Ekavi"},{"family":"Chrysohoou","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Tsigos","given":"Constantine"},{"family":"Randeva","given":"Harpal S"},{"family":"Yannakoulia","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Stefanadis","given":"Christodoulos"},{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Charalabos"},{"family":"Pitsavos","given":"Christos"}],"citation-key":"Kyrou2017","container-title":"European Journal of Preventive Cardiology","DOI":"10.1177/2047487316670918","ISBN":"2047-4873","ISSN":"20474881","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,27]]},"page":"145-152","PMID":"27671771","title":"Association of depression and anxiety status with 10-year cardiovascular disease incidence among apparently healthy Greek adults: The ATTICA Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27671771","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"Ladejobi2018a","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), except in those with completely reversible causes. We sought to examine the impact of ICD therapy on mortality in survivors of SCA associated with reversible causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the records of 1433 patients managed at our institution between 2000 and 2012 who were discharged alive after SCA. A reversible and correctable cause was identified in 792 (55%) patients. Reversible SCA cause was defined as significant electrolyte or metabolic abnormality, evidence of acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, recent initiation of antiarrhythmic drug or illicit drug use, or other reversible circumstances. Of the 792 SCA survivors because of a reversible and correctable cause (age 61±15 years, 40% women), 207 (26%) patients received an ICD after their index SCA. During a mean follow-up of 3.8±3.1 years, 319 (40%) patients died. ICD implantation was highly associated with lower all-cause mortality (P<0.001) even after correcting for unbalanced baseline characteristics (P<0.001). In subgroup analyses, only patients whose SCA was not associated with myocardial infarction extracted benefit from ICD (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of SCA because of a reversible and correctable cause, ICD therapy is associated with lower all-cause mortality except if the SCA was because of myocardial infarction. These data deserve further investigation in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial, as they may have important and immediate clinical implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ladejobi","given":"Adetola"},{"family":"Pasupula","given":"Deepak K."},{"family":"Adhikari","given":"Shubash"},{"family":"Javed","given":"Awais"},{"family":"Durrani","given":"Asad F."},{"family":"Patil","given":"Shantanu"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Dingxin"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Shahzad"},{"family":"Munir","given":"Muhammad Bilal"},{"family":"Rijal","given":"Shasank"},{"family":"Wayne","given":"Max"},{"family":"Adelstein","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Saba","given":"Samir"}],"citation-key":"Ladejobi2018a","container-title":"Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCEP.117.005940","ISSN":"19413084","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"PMID":"29545361","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Implantable defibrillator therapy in cardiac arrest survivors with a reversible cause","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ahajournals.org","volume":"11"},

The association between sleep disturbances and depression has long been recognised. Disturbed sleep is a diagnostic criterion for MDD, and insomnia commonly precedes the onset of symptomatic mood disorders. Disruptions of the sleep-wake cycle (sleep architecture and timing) are residual symptoms that may prevent the attainment of high-quality remission and delay recovery from MDD. Therefore, early recognition and treatment of sleep disturbances may be important for the treatment and prevention of recurrent depression. Evidence suggests that melatonergic (MT(1) and MT(2)) and the 5-HT(2C) serotonergic receptor subtypes are important modulators of circadian rhythmicity. Agomelatine is the first melatonergic antidepressant; an agonist of melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors, with additional antagonist properties at the 5-HT(2C) receptors. Agomelatine combines antidepressant efficacy including quality and efficiency of sleep, with a more favourable side-effect profile than current antidepressant treatments, including neutral effects on sexual function, bodyweight and the absence of discontinuation symptoms. These positive features provide a novel approach to the treatment of depression and the attainment of high-quality remission in MDD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Lam","given":"R W"}],"citation-key":"Lam2008","container-title":"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","DOI":"10.1177/0269881108092591","ISSN":"14617285","issue":"7 Suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"13-18","title":"Addressing circadian rhythm disturbances in depressed patients.","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

Observations during control of alveolar pCO2, first at 44 and then at 50 mm Hg, represented the effects of CO2 breathing, Intravenous infusion of NaHC03 solution (ca. 2.4 mEq/kg) while maintaining alveolar pC0z at 50 mm Hg revealed the responses to a lowering of blood [H+] without: concurrent change in arterial or internal jugular venous pCO2. Brain blood flow index varied directly with alteration in blood pC0~ and was unaffected by changes in blood pH not produced by pC02 change. Respiratory measurements indicated a prominent relationship between respiration and blood hydrogen ion concentration, the reversal of the acidemia normally associated with CO 2 administration removing approximately 4570 of respiratory stimulation induced by hyper-capnia. The remaining 55% of the increased ventilation caused by CO2 breathing was not directly related to changes in arterial or internal jugular venous blood pH or [HCO,]. The residual respiratory effect of CO2 administration was correlated, not only with alteration of pCO2, but with calculated changes in the pH of cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the total respiratory stimulation produced by CO2 breathing, and its diminution by bicarbonate infusion, can be quantitatively described either in terms of a single stimulus index, hydrogen ion concentration , or in terms of two factors, pH and pCU2. Choice between single and muItiple acid-base factors as indices of chemical stimuli in respiratory control remains arbitrary. However, the discussion re-emphasizes that, while respiratory changes do occur when blood pH is altered without: change of blood or central pCO2, comparable stimulant effects of molecular CO2 cannot be demonstrated without somewhere producing concurrent modification of pH.

  {"id":"Lampert2000","abstract":"Background—The incidence of sudden cardiac death increases in populations who experience disasters such as earthquakes. The physiological link between psychological stress and sudden death is unknown; one mechanism may be the direct effects of sympathetic arousal on arrhythmias. To determine whether mental stress alters the induction, rate, or termination of ventricular arrhythmias, we performed noninvasive programmed stimulation (NIPS) in patients with defibrillators and ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is known to be inducible and terminated by antitachycardia pacing, at rest and during varying states of mental arousal.\n\nMethods and Results—Eighteen patients underwent NIPS in the resting-awake state (nonsedated). Ten underwent repeat testing during mental stress (mental arithmetic and anger recall). Induced VT was faster in 5 patients (P=0.03). VT became more difficult to terminate in 5 patients during mental stress; 4 required a shock (P=0.03). There was no change in ease of induction with mental stress. There was no evidence of ischemia on ECG or continuous ejection fraction monitoring. Eight patients received a shock in the resting-awake state and did not perform mental stress.

  {"id":"Lampert2002","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that psychological stress increases the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Whether emotional or physical stressors can trigger spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in patients at risk has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were given diaries to record levels of defined mood states and physical activity, using a 5-point intensity scale, during 2 periods preceding spontaneously occurring ICD shocks (0 to 15 minutes and 15 minutes to 2 hours) and during control periods 1 week later. ICD-stored electrograms confirmed the rhythm at the time of shock. A total of 107 confirmed ventricular arrhythmias requiring shock were reported by 42 patients (33 men; mean age, 65 years; 78% had coronary artery disease) between August 1996 and September 1999. In the 15 minutes preceding shock, an anger level > or =3 preceded 15% of events compared with 3% of control periods (P<0.04; odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence intervals, 1.04 to 3.16) Other mood states (anxiety, worry, sadness, happiness, challenge, feeling in control, or interest) did not differ. Patients were more physically active preceding shock than in control periods. Anger and physical activity were independently associated with the preshock period.

Future investigations of therapies aimed at blocking a response to these stressors may decrease ventricular arrhythmias and shocks in these patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Joska","given":"Tammy"},{"family":"Burg","given":"Matthew M"},{"family":"Batsford","given":"William P"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Craig A"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Diwakar"}],"citation-key":"Lampert2002","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000031733.51374.C1","ISBN":"0009-7322","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"1800-1805","PMID":"12356633","title":"Emotional and physical precipitants of ventricular arrhythmia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.circulationaha.org","volume":"106"},
  {"id":"Lampert2003a","abstract":"This study evaluated the effects of propranolol on recovery of heart rate variability (HRV) after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to outcome in the Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Beta blockers improve mortality after acute myocardial infarction, but through an unknown mechanism. Depressed HRV, a measure of autonomic tone, predicts mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Whether β blockers influence recovery of HRV after acute myocardial infarction, and thereby improve outcome, is unknown. We compared 24-hour HRV parameters at 1 week after acute myocardial infarction and after 6 weeks of treatment with propanolol (n = 88) or placebo (n = 96). The relation between 25-month outcome (death/acute myocardial infarction/congestive heart failure), propranolol treatment, and HRV was further analyzed. After 6 weeks, high-frequency (HF) power (log-normalized), an index of vagal tone, increased more in propranolol-treated patients (4.28 ± 0.1 to 5.17 ± 0.09 ms2) than in placebo-treated patients (4.26 ± 0.09 to 4.77 ± 0.1 ms2, p <0.05). Sympathovagal balance measured by the low-frequency (LF) to HF ratio increased in placebo-treated patients (3.55 ± 0.24 to 3.86 ± 0.24) but decreased in those treated with propranolol (3.76 ± 0.29 to 3.17 ± 0.23, p <0.01). Other frequency-domain parameters increased over time but were not affected by propranolol. Propranolol blunted the morning increase in the LF/HF ratio. Recovery of HF, the strongest HRV predictor of outcome, and propranolol therapy independently predicted outcome. In summary, after acute myocardial infarction, propranolol therapy improves recovery of parasympathetic tone, which correlates with improved outcome, and decreases morning sympathetic predominance.

  {"id":"Lampert2007","abstract":"Introduction: While implantable defibrillator shocks save lives, shock can lead to ventricular arrhythmias. However, the mechanism of shock-related proarrhythmia remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of ICD shock on repolarization instability, a factor associated with ventricular arrhythmogenesis. Methods and Results: Sixty-five patients with ICDs underwent ambulatory ECG monitoring during defibrillation testing 3 months postimplant. TWA was analyzed continuously in the time domain during baseline, sedated, and post-shock states. RR, QRS, and QT intervals and catecholamines were also measured continuously. Adequate pre- and post-shock Holter data were recorded in 55 patients, 48 male, mean 64 ± 12 years, 50 with coronary disease, 48 with prior spontaneous or induced arrhythmia. TWA significantly increased after shock, from 9.6 ± 0.5 to 11.9 ± 0.6 μV, as did QRS duration, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels, compared with sedated and baseline states. RR intervals decreased minimally. TWA changes with shock were not associated with RR or QRS duration changes, but were associated with changes in epinephrine. Conclusions: ICD shock, even in the sedated state, increases repolarization instability as measured by TWA, an effect mediated in part by sympathetic stimulation. This association between shock and TWA may have important mechanistic and clinical implications for optimization of defibrillation therapy. © 2007 by Futura Publishing Company, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Soufer","given":"Robert"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Batsford","given":"William P."},{"family":"Tirado","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Earley","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Shusterman","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"Lampert2007","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8167.2007.00787.x","ISSN":"10453873","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"page":"512-517","PMID":"17428273","publisher":"J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol","title":"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks increase T-wave alternans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17428273/","volume":"18"},

Por otra parte, es importante evaluar la eficiencia de los modelos hidrológicos que predicen el movimiento del agua en el suelo. El objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar y comparar la bondad de ajuste de los modelos de infiltración de Kostiakov-Lewis (K-L) y Philip (Ph) a los datos experimentales, obtenidos en tres suelos: dos en la Pcia. de Buenos Aires y uno en el predio experimental de la Facultad de Agronomía de la Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. También se analizó la eficiencia de las funciones de pedotransferencia (FPT) de Saxton y Rawls (SyR) en la determinación de los parámetros hidráulicos de entrada del modelo de infiltración de Green y Ampt (GA) y en la predicción de la curva de liberación de agua. Los modelos de K-L y Ph ajustaron con R 2 mayores a 0,6 de lo cual se concluye que son altamente eficientes para describir el com-portamiento de la infiltración de agua en los suelos estudiados. La mayor tasa de infiltración básica (fo) fue de 0,42 cm min -1 y correspondió a un suelo arcillo-limoso con enmienda orgánica. Los otros dos suelos, franco-limoso y franco-arcilloso, exhibieron valores máximos de 0,03 y 0,07 cm min -1 respectivamente. El modelo de GA, a partir de las FPT, predijo los valores de infiltración con coeficientes de eficiencia (CE) mayores a 0,8 para dos de los suelos estudiados, aunque se obtuvieron algunas discrepancias por debajo de los 20 cm de profundidad. Para el suelo franco limoso las FPT predijeron la curva característica de humedad con un CE cercano a 0,9. Se aconseja realizar un número pequeño de ensayos preliminares en cualquier suelo bajo estudio, y analizar la bondad de predicción de estas funciones en esos sitios, des-cartando de este modo, situaciones que se apartan de las hipótesis del modelo.

Moreover, it is important to evaluate the efficiency of the hydrological models that predict the movement of water in soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate and to compare the goodness of fitting of Kostiakov-Lewis (K-L) and Philip (Ph) infiltration models to experimental data obtained from three soils: two of them at the Province of Buenos Aires, and the third one at the School of Agronomy's campus of the Buenos Aires University, (Argentina). Efficiency of Saxton and Rawls (SyR) pedotransfer functions (FPT) on the determination of the Green and Ampt (GA) model input hydraulic parameters and the prediction of the soil-moisture release curve were analyzed too. K-L and Ph models fitted data with R 2 coefficient greater than 0.6. Then it was concluded that these models accurately describe the infiltration process of the studied soils.

  {"id":"LaRovere1998","abstract":"Background. Experimental evidence suggests that autonomic markers such as heart-rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) may contribute to post-infarction risk stratification. There are clinical data to support this concept for heart-rate variability. The main objective of the ATRAMI study was to provide prospective data on the additional and independent prognostic value for cardiac mortality of heart-rate variability and BRS in patients after myocardial infarction in whom left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ventricular arrhythmias were known. Methods. This multicentre international prospective study enrolled 1284 patients with a recent (< 28 days) myocardial infarction, 24 h Holter recording was done to quantify heart-rate variability (measured as standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals [SDNN]) and ventricular arrhythmias. BRS was calculated from measurement of the rate-pressure response to intravenous phenylephrine. Findings. During 21 (SD 8) months of follow-up, the primary endpoint, cardiac mortality, included 44 cardiac deaths and five non-fatal cardiac arrests. Low values of either heart-rate variability (SDNN < 70 ms) or BRS (< 3.0 ms per mmHg) carried a significant multivariate risk of cardiac mortality (3.2 [95% CI 1.42-7.36] and 2.8 [1.24-6.16], respectively). The association of low SDNN and BRS further increased risk; the 2-year mortality was 17% when both were below the cut-offs and 2% (p < 0.0001) when both were well preserved (SDNN > 105 ms, BRS > 6.1 ms per mmHg). The association of low SDNN or BRS with LVEF below 35% carried a relative risk of 6.7 (3.1-14.6) or 8.7 (4.3-17.6), respectively, compared with patients with LVEF above 35% and less compromised SDNN ≤ 70 ms) and BRS (≤ 3 ms per mmHg). Interpretation. ATRAMI provides clinical evidence that after myocardial infarction the analysis of vagal reflexes has significant prognostic value independently of LVEF and of ventricular arrhythmias acid that it significantly adds to the prognostic value of heart-rate variability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"La Rovere","given":"Maria Teresa"},{"family":"Bigger","given":"J Thomas"},{"family":"Marcus","given":"Frank I"},{"family":"Mortara","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Peter J"}],"citation-key":"LaRovere1998","container-title":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11144-8","ISBN":"0140-6736","ISSN":"01406736","issue":"9101","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",2,14]]},"page":"478-484","PMID":"9482439","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Baroreflex sensitivity and heart-rate variability in prediction of total cardiac mortality after myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9482439","volume":"351"},
  {"id":"LaRovere2003","abstract":"Background - The predictive value of heart rate variability (HRV) in chronic heart failure (CHF) has never been tested in a comprehensive multivariate model using short-term laboratory recordings designed to avoid the confounding effects of respiration and behavioral factors. Methods and Results - A multivariate survival model for the identification of sudden (presumably arrhythmic) death was developed with data from 202 consecutive patients referred between 1991 and 1995 with moderate to severe CHF (age 52±9 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 24±7%, New York Heart Association class 2.3±0.7; the derivation sample). Time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters obtained from an 8′ recording of ECG at baseline and during controlled breathing (12 to 15 breaths/min) were challenged against clinical and functional parameters. This model was then validated in 242 consecutive patients referred between 1996 and 2001 (validation sample). In the derivation sample, sudden death was independently predicted by a model that included low-frequency power (LFP) of HRV during controlled breathing ≤13 ms2 and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ≥77 mm (relative risk [RR] 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.3, and RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.3, respectively). The derivation model was also a significant predictor in the validation sample (P=0.04). In the validation sample, LFP ≤11 ms2 during controlled breathing and ≥83 ventricular premature contractions per hour on Holter monitoring were both independent predictors of sudden death (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 7.6, and RR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 9.0, respectively). Conclusions - Reduced short-term LFP during controlled breathing is a powerful predictor of sudden death in patients with CHF that is independent of many other variables. These results refine the identification of patients who may benefit from prophylactic implantation of a cardiac defibrillator.","author":[{"family":"La Rovere","given":"Maria Teresa"},{"family":"Pinna","given":"Gian Domenico"},{"family":"Maestri","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Mortara","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Capomolla","given":"Soccorso"},{"family":"Febo","given":"Oreste"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Franchini","given":"Mariella"},{"family":"Gnemmi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Opasich","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Riccardi","given":"Pier Giorgio"},{"family":"Traversi","given":"Egidio"},{"family":"Cobelli","given":"Franco"}],"citation-key":"LaRovere2003","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000047275.25795.17","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",2,4]]},"page":"565-570","PMID":"12566367","title":"Short-term heart rate variability strongly predicts sudden cadiac death in chronic heart failure patients","type":"article-journal","volume":"107"},

We employed a co-culture of neonatal ventricular myocytes and sympathetic stellate neurons from normal (WKY) and pro-hypertensive (SHR) rats that are sympathetically hyper-responsive and measured nicotine evoked cAMP responses in the myocytes using a fourth generation FRET cAMP sensor. We demonstrated the dominant role of neurons in driving the myocyte ß-adrenergic phenotype, where SHR cultures elicited heightened myocyte cAMP responses during neural activation. Moreover, cross-culturing healthy neurons onto diseased myocytes rescued the diseased cAMP response of the myocyte. Conversely, healthy myocytes developed a diseased cAMP response if diseased neurons were introduced. Our results provide evidence for a dominant role played by the neuron in driving the adrenergic phenotype seen in cardiovascular disease. We also highlight the potential of using healthy neurons to turn down the gain of neurotransmission, akin to a smart pre-synaptic ß-blocker.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Larsen","given":"Hege E"},{"family":"Lefkimmiatis","given":"Konstantinos"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"David J"}],"citation-key":"Larsen2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep38898","ISSN":"20452322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"Sympathetic neurons are a powerful driver of myocyte function in cardiovascular disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.nature.com/scientificreports","volume":"6"},

The increased availability of bedside ultrasound has led to the use of this tool in the assessment of the fluid status of hypotensive patients. Dynamic changes in the IVC diameter can guide fluid resuscitation in a small subset of patients. We aimed to study whether resident physicians at different levels of training were able to identify patients in whom an IVC US would gauge intravascular fluid status appropriately. METHODS: We created a voluntary and anonymous questionnaire describing five distinct clinical vignettes and asked participants to identify whether they believed ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava would aid in determining the intravascular fluid status of the patient in question. Participants who chose IVC ultrasound as a modality to determine intravascular status were asked a follow-up question on whether IVC compressibility, distensibility, both, or neither should be assessed to make this determination. The survey included 35 internal medicine residents, 3 did not complete the survey. RESULTS: Residents at all levels of training favored using isolated IVC ultrasound to assess the intravascular fluid status of septic patients, irrespective of individual patient and scenario characteristics. 51% of participants favored IVC ultrasound in an inadequately resuscitated patient with septic shock. A majority endorsed the use of this tool, in patients that had already undergone adequate fluid resuscitation at 76.5%. 66% selected it in patients with underlying high right-sided pressures. 59.3% chose IVC US in mechanically ventilated patients with neuromuscular blockade and 37.5% without it. Of the participants that chose IVC ultrasound, no clear pattern emerged regarding which parameter they favored. Most residents chose collapsibility. In patients with ARDS who were mechanically ventilated, distensibility was more popular. 85% of residents surveyed felt that point of care ultrasonography should be incorporated into residency curriculum; the remainder were undecided. Results are summarized in Table1. CONCLUSIONS: Internal medicine resident physicians at all levels of training appear to be deficient in identifying the population of patients in whom IVC ultrasound can be appropriately used to assess fluid status. A majority of residents favored sub-optimal parameters when looking at the IVC indicating a knowledge gap. As portable ultrasonography becomes ubiquitous care must be taken, especially in unsupervised settings, to educate and train all operators before it is allowed to direct therapy in septic patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lashari","given":"B H"},{"family":"Hamid","given":"M"},{"family":"Shoukat","given":"U"},{"family":"Thacker","given":"P"},{"family":"Patel","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"Lashari","title":"D42 CRITICAL CARE: BLINDED BY THE LIGHT -IMAGING IN Inferior Vena Cava Ultrasound in Sepsis; Are Residents Able to Identify the Right Patients?","type":"article-journal"},

In this paper, the authors outline 3 regression approaches for estimating 2 key quantities in competing risks analysis: the cause-specific relative hazard (csRH) and the subdistribution relative hazard (sdRH). They compare and contrast the structure of the risk sets and the interpretation of parameters obtained with these methods. They also demonstrate the use of these methods with data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study established in 1993, treating time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy or to clinical disease progression as competing events. In our example, women with an injection drug use history were less likely than those without a history of injection drug use to initiate therapy prior to progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or death by both measures of association (csRH = 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.57, 0.80 and sdRH = 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 0.71). Moreover, the relative hazards for disease progression prior to treatment were elevated (csRH = 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.37, 2.13 and sdRH = 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.62, 2.51).

METHODS: We compared 10 sessions of biofeedback training with an uninstructed control. Cognitive and physiological effects were measured in four of the sessions. RESULTS: We found acute increases in low-frequency and total spectrum heart rate variability, and in vagal baroreflex gain, correlated with slow breathing during biofeedback periods. Increased baseline baroreflex gain also occurred across sessions in the biofeedback group, independent of respiratory changes, and peak expiratory flow increased in this group, independently of cardiovascular changes. Biofeedback was accompanied by fewer adverse relaxation side effects than the control condition. CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate variability biofeedback had strong long-term influences on resting baroreflex gain and pulmonary function.

  {"id":"Liao1996","abstract":"The shorter term beat-to-beat heart rate data collected from the general population are often interrupted by artifacts, and an arbitrary exclusion of such individuals from analysis may significantly reduce the sample size and/or introduce selection bias. A computer algorithm was developed to label as artifacts any data points outside the upper and lower limits generated by a 5-beat moving average ±25% (or set manually by an operator using a mouse) and to impute beat-to-beat heart rate throughout an artifact period to preserve the timing relationships of the adjacent, uncorrupted heart rate data. The algorithm applies Fast Fourier Transformation to the smoothed data to estimate low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF; 0.16-0.35 Hz) spectral powers and the HF/LF ratio as conventional indices of sympathetic, vagal, and vagal-sympathetic balance components, respectively. We applied this algorithm to resting, supine, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data collected in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to assess the performance (success rate) of the algorithm (N = 526) and the inter- and intra-data-operator repeatability of using this computer algorithm (N = 108). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the records could be smoothed by the computer-generated limits, an additional 4.8% by manually set limits, and 7.4% of the data could not be processed due to a large number of artifacts in the beginning or the end of the records. For the repeatability study, 108 records were selected at random, and two trained data operators applied this algorithm to the same records twice within a 6-month interval of each process (blinded to each other's results and their own prior results). The inter-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.86, 0.92, and 0.90 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively. The average intra-data-operator reliability coefficients were 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for the HF, LF, and HF/LF components, respectively.

We examined the association between HRV and incident CHD and non-CHD mortality in a cohort of 11,654 men and women aged 45–64 years at intake, from the biracial, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Supine, resting, 2-min beat-to-beat heart rate data were collected at the baseline examination. High frequency (HF; 0.15–0.40 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz) spectral powers, LF/HF ratio, normalized HF and LF, the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN), and the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (MSSD) were used as the conventional indexes of HRV to measure cardiac autonomic control. From this cohort, 635 cases of incident CHD (including 346 cases of incident myocardial infarction [MI] and 82 cases of fatal CHD), and 623 non-CHD deaths were identified and validated after an average of 8 years of follow-up. Among individuals with diabetes, the multivariable adjusted proportional hazards ratios (95% CI) were 2.03 (1.28–3.23), 1.60 (1.12–2.27), 1.50 (0.65–3.42), and 1.27 (0.84–1.91) for incident MI, incident CHD, fatal CHD, and non-CHD deaths, respectively, comparing the lowest quartile to the upper most three quartiles of HF. A similar pattern of associations was found for LF, SDNN, and MSSD. By contrast, there was no consistent pattern of associations among individuals without diabetes. At the population level, a lower HRV (reflective of impaired cardiac autonomic control) is statistically significantly related to the development of CHD among individuals with diabetes, independent of markers of the duration/severity of the glucose metabolism impairment. These data suggest a contribution of an impaired cardiac autonomic control to the risk of CHD among individuals with diabetes.</p>","author":[{"family":"Liao","given":"Duanping"},{"family":"Carnethon","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Gregory W."},{"family":"Cascio","given":"Wayne E."},{"family":"Heiss","given":"Gerardo"}],"citation-key":"Liao2002","container-title":"Diabetes","DOI":"10.2337/diabetes.51.12.3524","ISSN":"0012-1797","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",12,1]]},"page":"3524-3531","title":"Lower Heart Rate Variability Is Associated With the Development of Coronary Heart Disease in Individuals With Diabetes","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

However, despite being crucial for understanding underlying individual risk, the genetic underpinning of delta age is unknown.

The review assessed the strength, consistency, independence, and generalizability of the published studies. A total of 53 individual studies (32 reported on associations with all-cause mortality, 12 on cardiac mortality, and 22 on composite outcomes) and 4 meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of the demographic composition of study samples, definition and measurement of depression, length of follow-up, and covariates included in the multivariable models. Despite limitations in some individual studies, our review identified generally consistent associations between depression and adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS - : Despite the heterogeneity of published studies included in this review, the preponderance of evidence supports the recommendation that the American Heart Association should elevate depression to the status of a risk factor for adverse medical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lichtman","given":"Judith H."},{"family":"Froelicher","given":"Erika S."},{"family":"Blumenthal","given":"James A."},{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Doering","given":"Lynn V."},{"family":"Frasure-Smith","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Allan S."},{"family":"Leifheit-Limson","given":"Erica C."},{"family":"Sheps","given":"David S."},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Wulsin","given":"Lawson"}],"citation-key":"Lichtman2014","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIR.0000000000000019","ISSN":"15244539","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,25]]},"page":"1350-1369","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Depression as a risk factor for poor prognosis among patients with acute coronary syndrome: Systematic review and recommendations: A scientific statement from the american heart association","type":"article-journal","volume":"129"},

  {"id":"Liew2015","abstract":"Arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) may be caused by ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or pulseless electric activity/asystole. Effective risk stratification to identify patients at risk of arrhythmic SCD is essential for targeting our healthcare and research resources to tackle this important public health issue. Although our understanding of SCD because of pulseless electric activity/asystole is growing, the overwhelming majority of research in risk stratification has focused on SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. This review focuses on existing and novel risk stratification tools for SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. For patients with left ventricular dysfunction or myocardial infarction, advances in imaging, measures of cardiac autonomic function, and measures of repolarization have shown considerable promise in refining risk. Yet the majority of SCD-ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation occurs in patients without known cardiac disease. Biomarkers and novel imaging techniques may provide further risk stratification in the general population beyond traditional risk stratification for coronary artery disease alone. Despite these advances, significant challenges in risk stratification remain that must be overcome before a meaningful impact on SCD can be realized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Deyell","given":"Marc W."},{"family":"Krahn","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Goldberger","given":"Jeffrey J."}],"citation-key":"Liew2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304493","ISBN":"0009-7330","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"1907-1918","PMID":"26044247","title":"Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Stratification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304493","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"Lima2019","abstract":"Importance Acute mental stress can result in transient endothelial dysfunction, but the prognostic relevance of this phenomenon is unknown. Objective To determine the association between mental stress-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation and adverse cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital network between June 2011 and August 2014. A cohort of individuals with stable coronary artery disease were included. Data analysis took place from November 2018 to May 2019. Exposures Study participants were subjected to a laboratory mental stress task (public speaking). Main Outcomes and Measures Flow-mediated vasodilation was measured before and 30 minutes after a public-speaking mental stress task. We examined the association of the rest (prestress), poststress, and δ flow-mediated vasodilation (poststress minus prestress levels) with an adjudicated composite end point of adverse events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina leading to revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, medical history, and depression. Results A total of 569 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [9.3] years; 420 men [73.8%]). Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased from a mean (SD) of 4.8% (3.7%) before mental stress to 3.9% (3.6%) after mental stress (a 23% reduction; P < .001), and 360 participants (63.3%) developed transient endothelial dysfunction (a decrease in flow-mediated vasodilation). During a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 3.0 (2.9-3.1) years, 74 patients experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event. The presence of transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with a 78% increase (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.78 [95% CI, 1.15-2.76]) in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event. Both the δ flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.03-1.27] for each 1% decline) and poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (sHR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.24] for each 1% decline) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular event. Risk discrimination statistics demonstrated a significant model improvement after addition of either poststress flow-mediated vasodilation (change in the area under the curve, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.01-0.09]) or prestress plus δ flow-mediated vasodilation (change in the area under the curve, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.00-0.08]) compared with conventional risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, transient endothelial dysfunction with mental stress was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. Endothelial responses to stress represent a possible mechanism through which psychological stress may affect outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.","author":[{"family":"Lima","given":"Bruno B"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jeong Hwan"},{"family":"Uphoff","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy"},{"family":"Almuwaqqat","given":"Zakaria"},{"family":"Moazzami","given":"Kasra"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Kutner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ko","given":"Yi-An"},{"family":"Sheps","given":"David S"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J Douglas"},{"family":"Quyyumi","given":"Arshed A"},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"}],"citation-key":"Lima2019","container-title":"JAMA cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2019.3252","ISSN":"2380-6591","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"988-996","PMID":"31509180","title":"Association of Transient Endothelial Dysfunction Induced by Mental Stress With Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Men and Women With Coronary Artery Disease.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509180","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"Linder2023","abstract":"Purpose\nAssessing the risk of common, complex diseases requires consideration of clinical risk factors as well as monogenic and polygenic risks, which in turn may be reflected in family history. Returning risks to individuals and providers may influence preventive care or use of prophylactic therapies for those individuals at high genetic risk.\nMethods\nTo enable integrated genetic risk assessment, the eMERGE (electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics) network is enrolling 25,000 diverse individuals in a prospective cohort study across 10 sites. The network developed methods to return cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores, monogenic risks, family history, and clinical risk assessments via a genome-informed risk assessment (GIRA) report and will assess uptake of care recommendations after return of results.\nResults\nGIRAs include summary care recommendations for 11 conditions, education pages, and clinical laboratory reports. The return of high-risk GIRA to individuals and providers includes guidelines for care and lifestyle recommendations. Assembling the GIRA required infrastructure and workflows for ingesting and presenting content from multiple sources. Recruitment began in February 2022.\nConclusion\nReturn of a novel report for communicating monogenic, polygenic, and family history-based risk factors will inform the benefits of integrated genetic

  {"id":"Link2008","abstract":"Individuals with systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure may have decreased neuronal density, decreased neuronal function (reuptake or retention of norepinephrine), or a combination of these, plus reduction in postsynaptic -receptor density. Cardiac neuronal distribution and function can be imaged with standard cameras and PET using radiolabeled analogs of norepinephrine. Postsynaptic -adrenergic receptor distribution and density can be determined using PET. Multiple imaging studies of the presynaptic component have reported that those individuals with the lowest retention or fastest washout of the radiolabeled analogs have a much greater annual mortality than do those with greater retention or slower washout rate. The results of some studies have suggested that the image abnormalities are better predictors of death than are more common predictors of outcome such as ejection fraction, heart rate variability, and microvolt T-wave alternans. The variability between these studies makes it unclear which measure of presynaptic dysfunction is the most predictive. -Receptor imaging has not been evaluated as extensively as a prognostic tool as has presynaptic imaging.

  {"id":"Lip2010","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Contemporary clinical risk stratification schemata for predicting stroke and thromboembolism (TE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are largely derived from risk factors identified from trial cohorts. Thus, many potential risk factors have not been included. METHODS: We refined the 2006 Birmingham/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stroke risk stratification schema into a risk factor-based approach by reclassifying and/or incorporating additional new risk factors where relevant. This schema was then compared with existing stroke risk stratification schema in a real-world cohort of patients with AF (n = 1,084) from the Euro Heart Survey for AF. RESULTS: Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes compared. Patients classified as high risk ranged from 10.2% with the Framingham schema to 75.7% with the Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS(2) (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75, Diabetes, prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema categorized the largest proportion (61.9%) into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the Birmingham 2009 schema classified 15.1% into this category. The Birmingham 2009 schema classified only 9.2% as low risk, whereas the Framingham scheme categorized 48.3% as low risk. Calculated C-statistics suggested modest predictive value of all schema for TE. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally better (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS(2). However, those classified as low risk by the Birmingham 2009 and NICE schema were truly low risk with no TE events recorded, whereas TE events occurred in 1.4% of low-risk CHADS(2) subjects. When expressed as a scoring system, the Birmingham 2009 schema (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc acronym) showed an increase in TE rate with increasing scores (P value for trend = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel, simple stroke risk stratification schema, based on a risk factor approach, provides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS(2) schema, with low event rates in low-risk subjects and the classification of only a small proportion of subjects into the intermediate-risk category. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratification in patients with AF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lip","given":"Gregory YH Y.H."},{"family":"Nieuwlaat","given":"Robby"},{"family":"Pisters","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Deirdre A."},{"family":"Crijns","given":"Harry J.G.M."}],"citation-key":"Lip2010","container-title":"Chest","DOI":"10.1378/chest.09-1584","ISBN":"1931-3543 (Electronic)\\r0012-3692 (Linking)","ISSN":"19313543","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"page":"263-272","PMID":"19762550","title":"Refining clinical risk stratification for predicting stroke and thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation using a novel risk factor-based approach: The Euro Heart Survey on atrial fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.chestjournal.orgCHEST/137/","volume":"137"},

Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle.

  {"id":"Liu1997","abstract":"Although sympathetic activation is believed to promote atrial fibrillation (AF), the effects of sympathetic stimulation on AF have not been systematically studied. In seven morphine-chloralose-anesthetized dogs, autonomic decentralization increased atrial effective refractory period (ERP) and reentrant wavelength (WL) and decreased the duration of AF induced by burst atrial pacing. Graded bilateral stellate ansa stimulation decreased ERP and WL to values similar to those before decentralization but did not return AF duration to predecentralization values. Sympathetic and bilateral vagal stimulation were adjusted in six additional dogs to produce similar effects on ERP and WL. Despite comparable effects on mean WL, the duration of AF was increased by vagal stimulation from 14 +/- 5 (control) to 372 +/- 96 s (P < 0.001) but was not altered significantly (26 +/- 10 s) by sympathetic stimulation. Vagal stimulation increased the variability in atrial refractoriness, as indicated by the standard deviation of ERP at seven atrial sites and of activation frequency during AF at 112 recording sites, whereas sympathetic stimulation had no significant effect on these indexes of ERP heterogeneity. We conclude that sympathetic stimulation is much less effective than vagal stimulation in promoting AF and that heterogeneity in atrial ERP may be important in determining the ability to sustain AF.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"L."},{"family":"Nattel","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Liu1997","container-title":"The American Journal of Physiology","container-title-short":"Am J Physiol","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.1997.273.2.H805","ISSN":"0002-9513","issue":"2 Pt 2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"H805-816","PMID":"9277498","source":"PubMed","title":"Differing sympathetic and vagal effects on atrial fibrillation in dogs: role of refractoriness heterogeneity","title-short":"Differing sympathetic and vagal effects on atrial fibrillation in dogs","type":"article-journal","volume":"273"},

The mechanism of this improvement in the LV contractile function after SCS and its effects on the myocardial oxygen consumption remains unknown.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed thoracic SCS (T1-T2 level) followed by 4 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing in 9 adult pigs with ischemic heart failure (HF) induced by myocardial infarction (MI). At 24 hours off-pacing, detailed echocardiogram and invasive hemodynamic assessment were performed to determine LV contractile function and myocardial oxygen consumption. Serum norepinephrine level was measured before and after SCS. SCS was performed on 2 occasions for 15 minutes, 30 minutes apart (recovery) with 50 Hz frequency (pulse width 0.2 millisecond, 90% of motor threshold at 2 Hz output). Echocardiogram revealed significant decrease in LVEF (33.8 ± 1.8% vs 66.5 ± 1.7%, P < 0.01) after induction of MI and HF. Compared with MI and HF, acute SCS significantly increased LVEF and +dP/dt (all P < 0.05). Withdrawal of SCS during recovery decreased +dP/dt, but not LVEF that increased again with repeated SCS.

METHODS Data from 4,135 adults aged ≥45 years with a smoking history were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression that accounted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, and current smoking status, as well as the complex sampling design. RESULTS The distribution of smoking duration ranged from 19.2% (1-9 years) to 36.2% (≥30 years). Among 1,454 respondents who had smoked for ≥30 years, 58.3% were current smokers, 25.0% had frequent productive cough, 11.2% had frequent shortness of breath, 16.7% strongly agreed that shortness of breath affected physical activity, and 25.6% had been diagnosed with COPD. Prevalence of COPD and each respiratory symptom was lower among former smokers who quit ≥10 years earlier compared with current smokers. Smoking duration had a linear relationship with COPD (P<0.001) and all three respiratory symptoms (P<0.001) after adjusting for smoking status and other covariates. While COPD prevalence increased with prolonged smoking duration in both men and women, women had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of COPD in the 1-9 years, 20-29 years, and ≥30 years duration periods.

Methods: Genotypes at 11 CHD-relevant SNPs were determined in 350 Hypertension patients and 483 controls in Chinese Han population using χ2test, genetic model analysis and haplotype analysis. Results: In the allele model, CXCL12 rs1065297 “G” allele, CXCL12 rs4948878 “G” allele and CXCL12 rs10793538 “T” allele were associated with decreased risk of hypertension (rs1065297: OR = 0.53, p = 0.005; rs4948878: OR = 0.51, p = 0.004; rs10793538: OR = 0.58, p = 0.005).

Objective: To investigate the chronic effects after interrupting the ECANS-ICANS connections by ablating the SVC-Ao GP. Methods: A right thoracotomy in 10 dogs allowed stimulation at the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins (RSPV and RIPV, respectively), right atrial appendage (RAA), and SVC to determine effective refractory period (ERP) and atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility in the first operation. Group 1 (n = 5) received SVC-Ao GP ablation; group 2 (n = 5) received no ablation. A second operation and the same measurements were made 10 weeks later. A pacemaker with lead implanted at the RSPV recorded atrial fibrillation or tachycardia (AF/AT). Results: During the first operation in group 1, ERPs increased significantly in the SVC but not at the RSPV, RIPV, or RAA site immediately after ablation, whereas ERPs decreased significantly in the RSPV, RIPV, and RAA but not the SVC in the second operation performed 10 weeks later (compared to the ERP in the first operation). ERPs decreased and AF/AT burden increased significantly from weeks 4 and 5, respectively, after the first operation in group 1 dogs.

We also demonstrate that highly predictive variables do not necessarily appear as highly significant, thus evading the researcher using significance-based methods. We point out that what makes variables good for prediction versus significance depends on different properties of the underlying distributions. If prediction is the goal, we must lay aside significance as the only selection standard. We suggest that progress in prediction requires efforts toward a new research agenda of searching for a novel criterion to retrieve highly predictive variables rather than highly significant variables.

DESIGN Prospective cohort of patients with chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the upper extremity requiring therapeutic stellate ganglion blockade. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Fifteen adult ASA physical status I and II patients with the diagnosis of chronic regional pain syndrome type I and II of the arm were studied. Right stellate ganglion block was performed in nine subjects and a left in six. INTERVENTIONS Stellate ganglion block was performed with 10 mL of 1% plain Xylocaine. Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed immediately prior and 30 min following the block. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored at regular intervals. Global systolic function was determined by calculating ejection fraction. Regional systolic motion was evaluated on the short axis and four-chamber views using the American Society of Echocardiography criteria. Diastolic function was assessed with pulsed-wave Doppler of the left ventricular outflow tract and the mitral valve. Data collected included isovolumic relaxation time and early and atrial velocity patterns. MAIN RESULTS A successful stellate ganglion block was achieved in all patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly different during data collection. Patients who underwent a right stellate ganglion block showed no significant differences in systolic or diastolic function. Following a left stellate ganglion block, global and regional systolic function remained unchanged. Isovolumic relaxation time was increased but did not reach statistical significance (80 +/- 13 ms to 88 +/- 9 ms; p = 0.09). Left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV) were significantly increased (LVEDV from 73 +/- 9 mL to 100 +/- 9 mL, p < 0.02; LVESV from 31 +/- 4 mL to 37 +/- 4 mL, p < 0.03).

Notably, one aspect of PTSD, particularly in veterans, is its comorbidity with suicide. Elevated aggressiveness predicts high-risk to suicide in humans and despite the difficulty in reproducing a complex human suicidal behavior in rodents, aggressive behavior is a well reproducible behavioral trait of suicide. PTSD animal models are based on a peculiar phenotype, including exaggerated fear memory, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors associated with neurochemical dysregulations in emotional brain circuitry. The endocannabinoid and the neurosteroid systems regulate emotions and stress responses, and recent evidence shows these two systems are interrelated and critically compromised in neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, levels of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, as well as those of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and its congener, palmitoylethanolamide are decreased in PTSD. Similarly, the endocannabinoid system and neurosteroid biosynthesis are altered in suicidal individuals. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the only FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and depression, fail to help half of the treatment-seeking patients. This highlights the need for developing biomarker-based efficient therapies. One promising hypothesis points to stimulation of allopregnanolone biosynthesis as a valid end-point to predict treatment response in PTSD patients. This review highlights running findings on the role of the endocannabinoid and neurosteroid systems in PTSD and suicidal behavior both in a preclinical and clinical perspective. A specific focus is given to predictive PTSD/suicide animal models. Ultimately, we discuss the idea that disruption of neurosteroid and endocannabinoid biosynthesis may offer novel promising biomarker candidates to develop new treatments for PTSD and, perhaps, suicidal behavior.","author":[{"family":"Locci","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Pinna","given":"Graziano"}],"citation-key":"Locci2018","container-title":"Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.014","ISSN":"02785846","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"title":"Social isolation as a promising animal model of PTSD comorbid suicide: neurosteroids and cannabinoids as possible treatment options","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584618305839?dgcid=rss_sd_all"},

At 2 weeks after AMI (n = 70), the low-frequency component was significantly greater (69 ± 2 vs 53 ± 3 normalized units [NU], p < 0.05) and the high-frequency component was significantly smaller (17 ± 1 vs 35 ± 3 NU) than in 26 age-matched control subjects. This difference was likely to reflect an alteration of sympathovagal regulatory outflows with a predominance of sympathetic activity. At 6 (n = 33) and 12 (n = 29) months after AMI, a progressive decrease in the low- (62 ± 2 and 54 ± 3 NU) and an increase in the high-frequency (23 ± 2 and 30 ± 2 NU) spectral components was observed, which suggested a normalization of sympathovagal interaction. An increase in sympathetic efferent activity induced by tilt did not further modify the low-frequency spectral component (78 ± 3 vs 74 ± 3 NU) in a subgroup of 24 patients at 2 weeks after AMI. Instead, 1 year after AMI, this maneuver was accompanied by an increase in the low-frequency component (77 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU, p < 0.05) of a magnitude similar to the one observed in control subjects (78 ± 3 vs 53 ± 3 NU). These data indicate that the sympathetic predominance that is detectable 2 weeks after AMI is followed by recovery of vagal tone and a normalization of sympathovagal interaction, not only during resting conditions, but also in response to a sympathetic stimulus. © 1987.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Lombardi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Sandrone","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Pernpruner","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Garimoldi","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Cerutti","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Baselli","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Pagani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Malliani","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"Lombardi1987","container-title":"The American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/0002-9149(87)90601-1","ISBN":"0002-9149 (Print)\\r0002-9149 (Linking)","ISSN":"00029149","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["1987",12,1]]},"page":"1239-1245","PMID":"3687775","publisher":"Excerpta Medica","title":"Heart rate variability as an index of sympathovagal interaction after acute myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/science/article/pii/0002914987906011","volume":"60"},

This scheme obliges to manage proteins with different lengths, while deep learning models require same-shape input. To accomplish this, zeros are usually added to each sequence up to a established common length in a process called zero-padding. However, the effect of different padding strategies on model performance and data structure is yet unknown. We propose and implement four novel types of padding the amino acid sequences. Then, we analysed the impact of different ways of padding the amino acid sequences in a hierarchical Enzyme Commission number prediction problem. Results show that padding has an effect on model performance even when there are convolutional layers implied. Contrastingly to most of deep learning works which focus mainly on architectures, this study highlights the relevance of the deemed-of-low-importance process of padding and raises awareness of the need to refine it for better performance.

  {"id":"Lown1977","abstract":"Brain stimulation can provoke a variety of arrhythmias and lower the ventricular vulnerable threshold. In the animal with acute myocardial ischemia such stimuli suffice to provoke ventricular fibrillation. Vagal neural traffic or adrenal catecholamines are not the conduits for this brain-heart linkage. Accompanying increases in heart rate or blood pressure are not prerequisites for the changes in cardiac excitability. Increased sympathetic activity, whether induced by neural or neurohumoral action, predisposes the heart to ventricular fibrillation. Protection can be achieved with surgical and pharmacologic denervation or reflex reduction in sympathetic tone. With acute myocardial ischemia, augmented sympathetic activity accounts for the early surge of ectopic activity frequently precipitating ventricular fibrillation. Asymmetries in sympathetic neural discharge may also contribute to the genesis of serious arrhythmias. The vagus nerve, through its muscarinic action, exerts an indirect effect on cardiac vulnerability, the consequence of annulment of concomitant adrenergic influence, rather than of any direct cholinergic action on the ventricles. There exist anatomic, physiologic as well as molecular bases for such interactions. Available experimental evidence indicates that environmental stresses of diverse types can injure the heart, lower the threshold of cardiac vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation and, in the animal with coronary occlusion, provoke potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Available evidence indicates that in man, as in the experimental animal, administration of catecholamines can induce ventricular arrhythmia, whereas vagal activity exerts an opposite effect. Furthermore, in certain subjects diverse stresses and various psychologic states provoke ventricular ectopic activity. © 1977 Dun · Donnelley Publishing Corporation 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 All rights reserved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Lown","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Verrier","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Rabinowitz","given":"Stephen H."}],"citation-key":"Lown1977","container-title":"The American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/S0002-9149(77)80044-1","ISBN":"0002-9149 (Print)\\r0002-9149 (Linking)","ISSN":"00029149","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1977"]]},"page":"890-902","PMID":"860697","title":"Neural and psychologic mechanisms and the problem of sudden cardiac death","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002914977800441","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"Lown1979","abstract":"In the industrially developed countries, sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death. It was recognized at the dawn of recorded history and even depicted in Egyptian relief sculpture from the tomb of a noble of the Sixth dynasty approximately 4,500 years ago. Sudden cardiac death has left no age untouched. Sparing neither saint nor sinner, it has burdened man with a sense of uncertainty and fragility. The enormity of this problem demands attention. In the United States, sudden cardiac death claims about 1,200 lives daily, or approximately one victim every minute. It is the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 64 years, accounting for 32 percent of the fatalities in this group. Nearly 25 percent of persons dying suddenly have had no prior recognized symptoms of heart disease.The excess of widows observed in retirement communities is accounted for by the three- to fourfold greater incidence of sudden cardiac death among men. Sudden death in old age might be a blessing rather than a scourge, but instead it frequently explodes a man's life at its prime, at a median age of only 59 years. The medical profession has sensed the issue but has largely ignored sudden death as a problem amenable to solution. This indifference has not been the result of a lack of interest or concern but a reflection of the belief that sudden cardiac death was the inevitable culmination of coronary atherosclerosis. Because sudden death was unpredictable and afflicted the apparently healthy subject outside the hospital, the physician considered it an act of fate before which he was largely helpless. The advent of the coronary care unit has promoted a reassessment of this complex problem. It has become clear that sudden death is not the inexorable culmination of advanced coronary atherosclerosis but instead is the result of ventricular fibrillation and therefore is readily reversible.7,8If ventricular fibrillation were only the consequence of severe coronary atherosclerosis, once reversed it would promptly recur. However, patients treated for ventricular fibrillation seldom have recurring episodes, and they usually recover and survive for long periods.9,10The new concept that ventricular fibrillation is an electrical accident suggests that its cause is not anatomic and thereby contributes to the growing interest in redefining the basis for sudden death and developing methods for its containment. Until recently our inability to deal with sudden cardiac death has not been due to a gap in the application of knowledge but to a gap in knowledge itself. The purpose of this review is to indicate how much we know and to sketch the path of possible further progress. © 1979.","author":[{"family":"Lown","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"Lown1979","container-title":"The American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/S0002-9149(79)80021-1","ISBN":"0002-9149","ISSN":"00029149","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"page":"313-328","PMID":"83793","title":"Sudden cardiac death: The major challenge confronting contemporary cardiology","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"Lown1979a","abstract":"With the development of coronary care units in the 1960s, attitudes toward sudden cardiac death (SCD) began to change as physicians learned that cardiac arrest was reversible. The problem of SCD has two aspects an acute, precipitating factor and a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. Resolution of the problem requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Ven-tricular premature complexes (VPCs) have been related to the development of serious arrhythmias and early death, but the mere presence of VPCs does not discriminate risk of subsequent fatality. VPCs should be graded according to frequency, persistence, multiformity, repetitive pattern and degree of prematurity. Provocation of repetitive extrasystoles by R-on-T pacing may indicate the presence of a reduced threshold for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy may help protect patients resuscitated from VF against recurrent cardiac arrest. Neuropharmacologic factors perhaps affecting central nervous system sympathetic activity can alter cardiac vulnerability and may protect against VF. Findings in dogs indicate that psychologic stress can reduce the cardiac threshold for VF. If psychologic factors predispose to ventricular arrhythmias by increasing the level of sympathetic tone, lessening neural sympathetic activity should reduce the incidence of SCD. SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH (SCD) is one of the major challenges to contemporary cardiology. Its sheer magnitude demands attention, claiming over 400 thousand lives annually, or about 60% of all coronary heart disease fatalities. The problem of sudden death has been recognized since the beginning of recorded history, yet before the 1960s, SCD received scant attention from clinical and research communities. In part this related to the prevailing perception that SCD was the ultimate expression of severe, far-advanced and irreversible coronary athero-sclerosis. Since the SCD was unexpected and struck down the seemingly healthy subject outside the hospital , the physician deemed it an act of fate before which he or she was largely helpless. As is often true in science, new methodologies not only usher in new content, but also mold new attitudes. In the case of SCD it was the burgeoning coronary care units (CCU) of the 1960s that stimulated a new direction. CCU experience largely dispelled the sense of futility, for it became rapidly evident that cardiac arrest was reversible. Patients promptly resuscitated from primary electrical failure consistently recovered and survived for variable and prolonged periods determined by the extent of their underlying heart disease. Because ventricular fibrilla-tion (VF) had its highest incidence at the beginning of a myocardial ischemic episode, it was logical to assume that this same mechanism accounted for out-of-hospital sudden death. The CCU demonstrated that VF can be reversed as well as prevented. These findings have led to the development of two distinct strategies:' 1) to reach the patient promptly and initiate effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,2 and 2) to identify the patient at increased risk for SCD and institute a prophylactic program against potentially fatal ven-tricular arrhythmias.3 Community Response to Cardiac Arrest The logic of a well-organized community program permitting immediate response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not debatable. The critical factor is the expeditious reaching of the victim by personnel fully tutored in basic life support. This necessarily requires that large sectors of the population be trained and their skill in cardiopulmonary resuscitation be finely honed at all times for the unexpected emergency. In Seattle, where such a program has been in operation for over 6 years, there have been 346 long-term survivors out of 1710 episodes of VF encountered in the community.4 The percentage of immediate resuscitations has improved annually, as has the yield in long-term survivors. A disquieting aspect of the Seat-tle experience is the high incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest. The mortality rate has been 26% at 1 year and 36% at two years. The problem of SCD has two aspects-an acute, precipitating trigger as well as a chronic predisposition to electrical instability of the myocardium. The mere reversal of the cardiac arrest does not obviate the underlying electrophysiologic abnormality. For those successfully resuscitated there can be no assurance that the good fortune of a prompt response by a trained medical team will be repeated. Resolution of the problem of SCD ultimately requires identification and protection of the potential victim. Detecting the Patient at Risk The essential strategy currently followed in identifying the patient at risk and in preventing VF relies on the hypothesis that the ventricular premature complex (VPC) constitutes a risk factor.1 3Two questions, therefore, must be answered: 1) What is the evidence that VPCs indeed indicate predisposition to sudden death? 2) Is there any basis for concluding that control of VPCs will protect against VF? 1593 by guest on May 12, 2016 http://circ.ahajournals.org/ Downloaded from","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lown","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"Lown1979a","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.60.7.1593","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979",12]]},"page":"1593-1599","title":"Sudden cardiac death -- 1978.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://circ.ahajournals.org/","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"Lu2009a","abstract":"Aims Previous studies showed that autonomic activation by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) during myocardial refractoriness evokes rapid firing from pulmonary vein (PV) and atria, both in vitro and in vivo. This study sought to investigate the autonomic mechanism underlying the rapid firings at various sites by systematic ablation of multiple ganglionated plexi (GP).Methods and resultsIn 43 mongrel dogs, rapid firing-mediated atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by local HFS (200 Hz, impulse duration 0.1 ms, train duration 40 ms) to the PVs and atria during myocardial refractoriness. The main GP in the atrial fat pads or the ganglia along the ligament of Marshall (LOM) were then ablated. Ablation of the anterior right GP and inferior right GP significantly increased the AF threshold by HFS at the right atrium and PVs. The AF threshold at left atrium and PVs was significantly increased by ablation of the superior left GP and inferior left GP, and was further increased by ablation of the LOM. Ablation of left-or right-sided GP on the atria had a significant effect on contralateral PVs and atrium. Administration of esmolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg) significantly increased AF threshold at all sites.ConclusionHFS applied to local atrial and PV sites initiated rapid firing via activation of the interactive autonomic network in the heart. GP in either left side or right side contributes to the rapid firings and AF originating from ipsolateral and contralateral PVs and atrium. Autonomic denervation suppresses or eliminates those rapid firings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhibing"},{"family":"Scherlag","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jiaxiong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Lilei"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ji Hong"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Guodong"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Warren M."},{"family":"Lazzara","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Po","given":"Sunny S."}],"citation-key":"Lu2009a","container-title":"Cardiovascular Research","DOI":"10.1093/cvr/cvp194","ISSN":"00086363","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",11,1]]},"page":"245-252","publisher":"Narnia","title":"Autonomic mechanism for initiation of rapid firing from atria and pulmonary veins: Evidence by ablation of ganglionated plexi","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvp194","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"Madden2018","abstract":"Blood pressure (BP) fluctuates throughout the day. The pattern it follows represents one of the most important circadian rhythms in the human body. For example, morning BP surge has been suggested as a potential risk factor for cardio-vascular events occurring in the morning, but the accurate quantification of this phenomenon remains a challenge. Here, we outline a novel method to quantify morning surge. We demonstrate how the most commonly used method to model 24-hour BP, the single cosinor approach, can be extended to a multiple-component cosinor random-effects model. We outline how this model can be used to obtain a measure of morning BP surge by obtaining derivatives of the model fit. The model is compared with a functional principal component analysis that determines the main components of variability in the data. Data from the Mitchelstown Study, a population-based study of Irish adults (n = 2047), were used where a subsample (1207) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We demonstrate that our 2-component model provided a significant improvement in fit compared with a single model and a similar fit to a more complex model captured by b-splines using functional principal component analysis. The estimate of the average maximum slope was 2.857 mmHg/30 min (bootstrap estimates; 95% CI: 2.855-2.858 mmHg/30 min). Simulation results allowed us to quantify the between-individual SD in maximum slopes, which was 1.02 mmHg/30 min.

  {"id":"Madias2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, there are no specific diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) signs for Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) to differentiate it from acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Myocardial oedema has been detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with TTS. Recently it has been postulated that myocardial oedema may be the cause of low QRS voltage (LQRSV) in the admission ECG and attenuation of the amplitude of the QRS complexes (AAQRS) in serial ECGs, noted in a few published cases of patients with TTS. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the admission ECG of patients with documented TTS reveals LQRSV and whether AAQRS is found when serial ECGs are compared in such patients.\\n\\nMETHODS: This study evaluated the prevalence of LQRSV in the admission ECG and AAQRS in serial ECGs in patients with TTS. ECGs of 368 patients with TTS from published reports in the international literature were evaluated for LQRSV (≤5 mm in limb leads and/or ≤10 mm in precordial leads) and AAQRS in serial ECGs.\\n\\nRESULTS: LQRSV was seen in 91.5% of 200 patients with TTS and one ECG, with a distribution of 49.0, 42.8, 51.0, 52.0, and 46.9%, in lead aVR, and inferior, anterior, lateral, and high lateral ECG lead groups, respectively.

The incidence per 1000 population per year by age group (less than 50, 50-69, greater than or equal to 70 years) was 0.19, 3.6, 11.4 in men and 0.12, 1.0, and 6.4 in women. The increasing incidence with age was significant. Ischaemic heart disease or hypertension had been recorded in 75% (124/166) of patients. Prodromes were reported in 54% (38/71) of patients with angina, and in 26% (25/95) without. Nineteen per cent (32/166) had neither prodromes nor overt heart disease. Forty six per cent of patients with known ischaemic heart disease and 24% without had consulted a doctor less than four weeks before death. Eight per cent had had a myocardial infarction within a year of death.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Madsen","given":"Jan Kyst"}],"citation-key":"Madsen1985","container-title":"Br Heart J","DOI":"10.1136/hrt.54.1.27","ISBN":"0007-0769","ISSN":"0007-0769","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"page":"27-32","PMID":"4015913","title":"Ischaemic heart disease and prodromes of sudden cardiac death.

  {"id":"Magnani2016","abstract":"IMPORTANCE: The adverse outcomes associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) have been studied in predominantly white cohorts. Racial differences in outcomes associated with AF merit continued investigation.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the race-specific associations of AF with stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease (CHD), and all-cause mortality in a community-based cohort.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study is a prospective, observational cohort. From 1987 through 1989, the ARIC Study enrolled 15 792 men and women and conducted 4 follow-up examinations (2011-2013) with active surveillance for vital status and hospitalizations. Race was determined by self-report and categorized as white, black, or other.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Atrial fibrillation (adjudicated using electrocardiograms, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates), stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality.\nRESULTS: After exclusions, 15 080 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.2 [5.8] years; 8290 women [55.5%]; 3831 black individuals [25.4%]) were included in this analysis. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 20.6 (6.2) years, there were 2348 cases of incident AF. The incident rates of AF per 1000 person-years were 8.1 (95% CI, 7.7-8.5) in white individuals and 5.8 (95% CI, 5.2-6.3) in black individuals. The rates of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality were higher in black individuals with AF than white individuals with AF. The association of AF with these outcomes, estimated with rate differences (rate of the end point in those with AF minus the rate in those without AF per 1000 person-years), also differed by race. The rate difference for stroke in individuals with AF was 10.2 (95% CI, 6.6-13.9) in white individuals and 21.4 (95% CI, 10.2-32.6) in black individuals. For heart failure and CHD, the rate differences were 1.5- to 2.0-fold higher in black individuals than white individuals. White individuals with AF had a rate difference of 55.9 (95% CI, 48.1-63.7) for mortality compared with black individuals, who had a rate difference of 106.0 (95% CI, 86.0-125.9).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the prospective ARIC Study, the outcome of AF on the rates of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality was considerably larger in black individuals than white individuals. These results indicate the vulnerability and increased risk in black individuals with AF. Continued investigation of racial differences in AF and its related adverse outcomes are essential to identify and mitigate racial disparities in the treatment of AF.","author":[{"family":"Magnani","given":"Jared W."},{"family":"Norby","given":"Faye L."},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sunil K."},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lin Y."},{"family":"Loehr","given":"Laura R."},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"}],"citation-key":"Magnani2016","container-title":"JAMA cardiology","container-title-short":"JAMA Cardiol","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2016.1025","ISSN":"2380-6591","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"433-441","PMCID":"PMC5347977","PMID":"27438320","source":"PubMed","title":"Racial Differences in Atrial Fibrillation-Related Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study","title-short":"Racial Differences in Atrial Fibrillation-Related Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Mahale2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM Chronic HCV infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs). Data on the effect of sustained virological response (SVR) on the risk of EHMs are limited. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data of patients from the US Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry who had a positive HCV RNA test (10/1999-08/2009). Patients receiving interferon-based antiviral therapy (AVT) were identified. SVR was defined as negative HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after end of AVT. Risks of eight incident EHMs were evaluated in Cox regression models. RESULTS Of the 160 875 HCV-infected veterans, 31 143 (19.4%) received AVT, of whom 10 575 (33.9%) experienced SVR. EHM risk was reduced in the SVR group compared with untreated patients for mixed cryoglobulinaemia (adjusted HR (aHR)=0.61; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94), glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.62; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) (aHR=0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.83), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (aHR=0.64; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.95), diabetes (aHR=0.82; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.88) and stroke (aHR=0.84; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94), but not for lichen planus (aHR=1.11; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.56) or coronary heart disease (aHR=1.12; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.56). Risk reductions were also observed when patients with SVR were compared with treated patients without SVR for mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, PCT and diabetes. Significant reductions in the magnitude of aHRs towards the null with increasing time to initiation of AVT after HCV diagnosis were observed for glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke. CONCLUSIONS Risks of several EHMs of HCV infection are reduced after AVT with SVR. However, early initiation of AVT may be required to reduce the risk of glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mahale","given":"Parag"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Ruosha"},{"family":"Torres","given":"Harrys A."},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Lu Yu"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Eric L."},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Jennifer R."}],"citation-key":"Mahale2018","container-title":"Gut","DOI":"10.1136/gutjnl-2017-313983","ISSN":"14683288","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"553-561","PMID":"28634198","title":"The effect of sustained virological response on the risk of extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-313983","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"Maharani2021","abstract":"Background: Rheumatic mitral stenosis is the most common valvular abnormalities found in developing countries. Mortality risk in those populations was poorly investigated. In addition, hemodynamic, morphological, and mechanical factors that influence or predict outcome of rheumatic mitral stenosis have not been identified. Aims: To determine predictive factors affecting outcome in rheumatic mitral stenosis patients. Method: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the National General Hospital Dr. Sardjito, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The study recruited patients from the Valvular Heart Disease Registry from May 2014 to November 2020. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, invasive or surgical treatment, and incidence of death were recorded. The baseline rhythm from electrocardiography (ECG) was categorized as sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Based on the findings of trans thoracal echocardiography (TTE), subjects who had moderate to severe pure rheumatic mitral stenosis (or followed by mitral regurgitation and / or less significant tricuspid regurgitation as a natural history) and subjects with rheumatic mitral stenosis with a combination of other heart valve problems (of which severity more significantly) classified as groups I and II. The mitral valve area (MVA), mitral valve gradient (MVG), left atrial diameter (LA), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) were then analyzed. Results: A total of 477 patients (mean age 44.08 ± 10.93 years; 71.5% female) were enrolled in this study. There were 61 deaths during the median follow up of 393 days of which 35 deaths occurred in group I and 26 deaths occurred in group II. Kaplan Meier curve shows the 1 year survival rate is higher in group I than group II which is 92.5% and 92%, respectively. Bivariate followed by multivariate analysis showed MVG and mPAP were predictive risk factors for mortality in group I with p = 0.020 and p = 0.021. MVG parameter values evaluated from echocardiography with a cut-off of more than 10 mmHg and mPAP parameters with a cut-off of more than 50 mmHg were independent predictive risk factors for mortality. Thus, patients were at higher risk of death if MVG &gt; 10 mmHg and mPAP &gt; 50 mmHg Conclusion: One year survival rate in group I was higher than group II.

  {"id":"Malpas1998","abstract":"ÐThis review focuses on that most engaging feature of the sympathetic nervous system, its rhythmicity. In particular examining the nature of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), its characteristics, the frequencies of these rhythms and possible mechanisms responsible for their generation. Sympathetic activity can be thought of as a complex output of the central nervous system providing subtle control over end organ function. This control is exerted in a number of frequency bands including rhythms related to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, 10 Hz, and between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. The generation and control over the occurrence of each of these rhythms is likely to be quite separate. Although aerent feedback from sources such as baroreceptors can explain some of the rhythmical properties in each case there is good evidence for inherent generation of aspects of these rhythms. A variety of brainstem cell groups are thought to be involved in their generation with the rostral ventrolateral medulla, although unlikely to be solely responsible for tone generation, an important regulator of overall activity. SNA also varies in the number of nerves recruited to ®re in each synchronized discharge.

  {"id":"Malpas2010a","abstract":"This review examines how the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of cardiovascular function over multiple time scales. This is achieved through differential regulation of sympathetic outflow to a variety of organs. This differential control is a product of the topographical organization of the central nervous system and a myriad of afferent inputs. Together this organization produces sympathetic responses tailored to match stimuli. The long-term control of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is an area of considerable interest and involves a variety of mediators acting in a quite distinct fashion. These mediators include arterial baroreflexes, angiotensin II, blood volume and osmolarity, and a host of humoral factors. A key feature of many cardiovascular diseases is increased SNA. However, rather than there being a generalized increase in SNA, it is organ specific, in particular to the heart and kidneys. These increases in regional SNA are associated with increased mortality. Understanding the regulation of organ-specific SNA is likely to offer new targets for drug therapy. There is a need for the research community to develop better animal models and technologies that reflect the disease progression seen in humans. A particular focus is required on models in which SNA is chronically elevated.

The His bundle elec-trograms obtained during sinus rhythm demonstrated a normal A-H (atrium-to-His bundle) time in one patient and a low normal A-H time in two patients. The H-V (His bundle-to-ventricle) time was short in all three patients. Atrial pacing in two patients produced an attenuated degree of prolongation of the A-H time without a change in conduction distal to the proximal His bundle.

  {"id":"Manuck1988","abstract":"Epidemiologic evidence increasingly implicates psychosocial variables in the development of coronary heart disease in human beings, an association that appears to be independent of the effects of other coronary disease risk factors. It has been hypothesized that behavioral influences on coronary heart disease are mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, perhaps through exacerbation of coronary artery atherosclerosis. This article summarizes several studies of the effects of stress and sympathetic arousal on atherosclerosis in a nonhuman primate model of atherogenesis. The application of a behavioral stressor involving periodic reorganization of social group memberships resulted in worsened coronary atherosclerosis among male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a cholesterol-containing diet, relative to control animals housed in groups of fixed (stable) membership, but only among those monkeys that retained dominant social status during the course of the study. This effect could not be attributed to concomitant variability in blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations. When the same experimental procedures were applied to males fed a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, the manipulation of group memberships similarly led to development of greater atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In related observations, monkeys that exhibited the largest heart rate responses to a standardized behavioral challenge had more extensive coronary atherosclerosis than animals showing a less pronounced cardiac responsivity to stress. In a final investigation, we observed that the exacerbated atherosclerosis of dominant monkeys consuming an atherogenic diet and housed in unstable social groups could be prevented by long-term administration of a β-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent, propranolol hydrochloride. © 1988.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Manuck","given":"Stephen B."},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Jay R."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Clarkson","given":"Thomas B."}],"citation-key":"Manuck1988","container-title":"American Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1016/0002-8703(88)90110-X","ISSN":"10976744","issue":"1 PART 2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"328-333","PMID":"2899392","title":"Effects of stress and the sympathetic nervous system on coronary artery atherosclerosis in the cynomolgus macaque","type":"article-journal","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"Marban1986","abstract":"Drug-induced triggered arrhythmias in heart muscle involve oscillations of membrane potential known as delayed or early afterdepolarizations (DADs or EADs). We examined the mechanism of DADs and EADs in ferret ventricular muscle. Membrane potential, tension and aequorin luminescence were measured during exposure to elevated [Ca2+](o), strophanthidin and/or isoproterenol (to induce DADs), or cesium chloride (to induce EADs). Ryanodine (10-9-10-6 M), an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, rapidly suppressed DADs and triggered arrhythmias. When cytoplasmic Ca2+-buffering capacity was enhanced by loading cells with the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA or quin2, DADs were similarly inhibited, as were contractile force and aequorin luminescence. In contrast to DADs, EADs induced by Cs were not suppressed by ryanodine or by loading with intracellular Ca2+ chelators. The possibility that transsarcolemmal Ca2+ entry might produce EADs was evaluated with highly specific dihydropyridine Ca channel agonists and antagonists. Bay K8644 (100-300 nM) potentiated EADs, whereas nitrendipine (3-20 μM) abolished EADs. We conclude that DADs and DAD-related triggered arrhythmias are activated by an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, whereas EADs do not require elevated [Ca2+](i) but rather arise as a direct consequence of Ca2+ entry through sarcolemmal slow Ca channels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Marban","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Shawn W"},{"family":"Wier","given":"W G"}],"citation-key":"Marban1986","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI112701","ISSN":"00219738","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]},"page":"1185-1192","PMID":"3771791","title":"Mechanisms of arrhythmogenic delayed and early afterdepolarizations in ferret ventricular muscle","type":"article-journal","volume":"78"},

  {"id":"Marcus2008","abstract":"Background: Although evidence suggests that alcohol is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), the association between alcohol and atrial flutter (AFL) has not been examined. The mechanism connecting alcohol and atrial arrhythmias is unknown. Methods: Alcohol intake was determined in 195 consecutive patients with AF and AFL. Control subjects included patients with other supraventricular arrhythmias (n = 132) and healthy subjects (n = 54). Because of important competing risk factors for atrial arrhythmias in the elderly, stratification by age was performed. In a subset, atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs) were obtained from the high right atrium and proximal and distal coronary sinus. Results: AF and AFL patients were significantly more likely to be daily alcohol drinkers (27% vs 14% of controls, P = 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AFL patients ≤ 60 years of age were significantly more likely to be daily drinkers than to drink no alcohol compared to controls (odds ratio 17, 95% confidence interval 1.6-192.0, P = 0.019). Progressively more frequent alcohol intake was significantly associated with a progressively greater odds of AFL in patients ≤ 60 years of age (P = 0.045). Neither AF subjects of any age nor AFL subjects > 60 years of age exhibited significant associations with alcohol after multivariable adjustment. Right AERPs shortened significantly with increasing amounts of alcohol intake (P = 0.025), whereas left AERPs were not associated with alcohol intake. Conclusions: Alcohol intake is positively associated with AFL in younger patients. The mechanism may be related to a shortening of the right AERP. © 2008, The Authors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Marcus","given":"Gregory M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Lisa M."},{"family":"Whiteman","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Tseng","given":"Zian H."},{"family":"Badhwar","given":"Nitish"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Byron K."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Randall J."},{"family":"Scheinman","given":"Melvin M."},{"family":"Olgin","given":"Jeffrey E."}],"citation-key":"Marcus2008","container-title":"PACE - Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8159.2008.00985.x","ISSN":"01478389","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"page":"266-272","PMID":"18307620","publisher":"Pacing Clin Electrophysiol","title":"Alcohol intake is significantly associated with atrial flutter in patients under 60 years of age and a shorter right atrial effective refractory period","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.cc.uic.edu/18307620/","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"Mark2016","abstract":"Pvalues and hypothesis testing methods are frequently misused in clinical research. Much of this misuse appears to be owing to the widespread, mistaken belief that they provide simple, reliable, and objective triage tools for separating the true and important from the untrue or unimportant. The primary focus in interpreting therapeutic clinical research data should be on the treatment (“oomph”) effect, a metaphorical force that moves patients given an effective treatment to a different clinical state relative to their control counterparts. This effect is assessed using 2 complementary types of statistical measures calculated from the data, namely, effect magnitude or size and precision of the effect size. In a randomized trial, effect size is often summarized using constructs, such as odds ratios, hazard ratios, relative risks, or adverse event rate differences. How large a treatment effect has to be to be consequential is a matter for clinical judgment. The precision of the effect size (conceptually related to the amount of spread in the data) is usually addressed with confidence intervals.Pvalues (significance tests) were first proposed as an informal heuristic to help assess how “unexpected” the observed effect size was if the true state of nature was no effect or no difference. Hypothesis testing was a modification of the significance test approach that envisioned controlling the false-positive rate of study results over many (hypothetical) repetitions of the experiment of interest. Both can be helpful but, by themselves, provide only a tunnel vision perspective on study results that ignores the clinical effects the study was conducted to measure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Mark","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kerry L."},{"family":"Harrell","given":"Frank E."}],"citation-key":"Mark2016","container-title":"JAMA Cardiology","DOI":"10.1001/jamacardio.2016.3312","ISBN":"2380-6591 (Electronic)","ISSN":"23806591","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"page":"1048-1054","PMID":"27732700","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Understanding the role of P values and hypothesis tests in clinical research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://cardiology.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2016.3312","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Marouf2011","abstract":"Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease that causes chronic hemolytic anemia. Its pathognomonic signs and symptoms are caused by hemoglobin (Hb) S, which results from a single nucleotide substitution in the β-globin gene that places the amino acid valine with glutamic acid at codon 6 of the β-globin chain. Hb S is an insoluble Hb that crystalizes at low oxygen tension and other precipitating conditions leading to rigidity of red cells and clumping in small blood vessels. Patients with sickle cell disease have a variable Hb level that may range from 7.0 to 11.0 g/dL in their steady state condition. The most common cause of hospital presentation is due to acute painful crisis that results from vaso-occlusion by sickled cells. These episodes are treated with hydration and analgesia and do not require blood transfusion. Blood transfusion should be aimed to increase tissue delivery of oxygen. Hb S is known to be a low affinity Hb and so delivers oxygen at a lower partial pressure of oxygen compared to Hb A. Even with adequate pre transfusion testing and precautions, blood transfusion is never totally safe and short or long term complications may occur. Blood transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease has only limited indications such as acute hemolytic, aplastic or sequestration crises. Chronic transfusion protocols are implemented in cases of strokes or high cerebral blood flow ultrasonic studies as a prophylactic measure. Exchange blood transfusion is used in some complications of the disease such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism or peri operatively.

Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has been proposed as a means of improving outcomes among patients with heart failure who are otherwise receiving appropriate treatment. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who did not have a response to antiarrhythmic drugs, had unacceptable side effects, or were unwilling to take these drugs to undergo either catheter ablation (179 patients) or medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) (184 patients) for atrial fibrillation in addition to guidelines-based therapy for heart failure. All the patients had New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, and an implanted defibrillator. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the primary composite end point occurred in significantly fewer patients in the ablation group than in the medicaltherapy group (51 patients [28.5%] vs. 82 patients [44.6%]; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.87; P = 0.007). Significantly fewer patients in the ablation group died from any cause (24 [13.4%] vs. 46 [25.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.86; P = 0.01), were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (37 [20.7%] vs. 66 [35.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P = 0.004), or died from cardiovascular causes (20 [11.2%] vs. 41 [22.3%]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.84; P = 0.009).

We evaluated the lifetime risk at different PRS levels, and the impact on disease onset and on prediction together with clinical risk scores. Compared to having an average PRS, having a high PRS contributed 21% to 38% higher lifetime risk, and 4 to 9 years earlier disease onset. PRSs improved model discrimination over age and sex in type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and over clinical risk in type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and prostate cancer. In all diseases, PRSs improved reclassification over clinical thresholds, with the largest net reclassification improvements for early-onset coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and prostate cancer.

  {"id":"Marston2023","abstract":"Interest in targeted screening programmes for atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased, yet the role of genetics in identifying patients at highest risk of developing AF is unclear.A total of 36,662 subjects without prior AF were analyzed from four TIMI trials. Subjects were divided into quintiles using a validated polygenic risk score (PRS) for AF. Clinical risk for AF was calculated using the CHARGE-AF model. Kaplan–Meier event rates, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), C-indices, and net reclassification improvement were used to determine if the addition of the PRS improved prediction compared with clinical risk and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Over 2.3 years, 1018 new AF cases developed. AF PRS predicted a significant risk gradient for AF with a 40% increased risk per 1-SD increase in PRS [HR: 1.40 (1.32–1.49); P &lt; 0.001]. Those with high AF PRS (top 20%) were more than two-fold more likely to develop AF [HR 2.45 (1.99–3.03), P &lt; 0.001] compared with low PRS (bottom 20%). Furthermore, PRS provided an additional gradient of risk stratification on top of the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score, ranging from a 3-year incidence of 1.3% in patients with low clinical and genetic risk to 8.7% in patients with high clinical and genetic risk. The subgroup of patients with high clinical risk, high PRS, and elevated NT-proBNP had an AF risk of 16.7% over 3 years. The C-index with the CHARGE-AF clinical risk score alone was 0.65, which improved to 0.67 (P &lt; 0.001) with the addition of NT-proBNP, and increased further to 0.70 (P &lt; 0.001) with the addition of the PRS.In patients with cardiovascular conditions, AF PRS is a strong independent predictor of incident AF that provides complementary predictive value when added to a validated clinical risk score and NT-proBNP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Marston","given":"Nicholas A"},{"family":"Garfinkel","given":"Amanda C"},{"family":"Kamanu","given":"Frederick K"},{"family":"Melloni","given":"Giorgio M"},{"family":"Roselli","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Jarolim","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Berg","given":"David D"},{"family":"Bhatt","given":"Deepak L"},{"family":"Bonaca","given":"Marc P"},{"family":"Cannon","given":"Christopher P"},{"family":"Giugliano","given":"Robert P"},{"family":"O’Donoghue","given":"Michelle L"},{"family":"Raz","given":"Itamar"},{"family":"Scirica","given":"Benjamin M"},{"family":"Braunwald","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Morrow","given":"David A"},{"family":"Ellinor","given":"Patrick T"},{"family":"Lubitz","given":"Steven A"},{"family":"Sabatine","given":"Marc S"},{"family":"Ruff","given":"Christian T"}],"citation-key":"Marston2023","container-title":"European Heart Journal","container-title-short":"European Heart Journal","DOI":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehac460","ISSN":"0195-668X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,14]]},"page":"221-231","source":"Silverchair","title":"A polygenic risk score predicts atrial fibrillation in cardiovascular disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac460","volume":"44"},

A mnemonic for strategies to augment teaching rounds for hospitalists was created using an approach that considers time limitations due to duty hours as well as the preferences of Millennial learners. These strategies to enhance learning during teaching rounds are Flipping the Wards, Using Documentation to Teach, Technology-Enabled Teaching, Using Guerilla Teaching Tactics, Rainy Day Teaching, and Embedding Teaching Moments into Rounds (FUTURE). Hospitalists serving as teaching attendings should consider these possible strategies as ways to enhance teaching in the post-duty hours era. These techniques appeal to the preferences of today's learners in an environment often limited by time constraints.

  {"id":"Martins1980","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine if autonomic nerve interventions exerted quantitatively dissimilar effects on recovery properties of endocardium compared with epicardium. Effective refractory periods (ERP) were measured by the extrastimulus technique in the endocardium and epicardium of the canine left ventricular anterior wall. The basic train and premature stimuli were administered to the endocardium and overlying epicardium via different poles on the same multipolar needle electrode, using cathodal stimuli. Sympathetic augmentation produced via bilateral carotid arterial occlusion or electrical stimulation of right, left, and both sympathetic nerves shortened ERP. Bilateral sympathetic denervation prolonged ERP. The canges in ERP of the endocardium were no different than were changes in the ERP of overlying epicardium. In separate studies, electrical stimulation of the cervical vagi prolonged ERP similarly in epicardium and endocardium. Pacing at slower rates or physostigmine administration potentiated the ERP prolongation in endocardium similar to epicardium. Augmented sympathetic tone produced by carotid occlusion also potentiated prolongation of ERP by vagal stimulation. The percent change in endocardial sites was slightly but significantly less than in epicardial sites. ERP prolongation due to vagal stimulation was attenuated markedly after sympathectomy and abolished with both propranolol and atropine. We conclude that, in the normal anterior left ventricular myocardium of the dog, sympathetic augmentation shortens ERP in epicardial sites equivalent to that in the underlying endocardial sites, that vagal nerve stimulation prolongs ERP in epicardial sites equal to or slightly greater than in the underlying endocardial sites, and that vagal stimulation antagonizes background sympathetic activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Martins","given":"James B"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"Douglas P"}],"citation-key":"Martins1980","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/01.RES.46.1.100","ISSN":"00097330","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"page":"100-110","title":"Effects of sympathetic and vagal nerves on recovery properties of the endocardium and epicardium of the canine left ventricle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ahajournals.org","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"Mathai2016a","abstract":"The lung is a common site of complications of systemic connective tissue disease (CTD), and lung involvement can present in several ways. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension are the most common lung manifestations in CTD. Although it is generally thought that interstitial lung disease develops later on in CTD it is often the initial presentation (\"lung dominant\" CTD). ILD can be present in most types of CTD, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis or dermatomyositis, Sjögrens syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease. Despite similarities in clinical and pathologic presentation, the prognosis and treatment of CTD associated ILD (CTD-ILD) can differ greatly from that of other forms of ILD, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can present as a primary vasculopathy in pulmonary arterial hypertension or in association with ILD (PH-ILD). Therefore, detailed history, physical examination, targeted serologic testing, and, occasionally, lung biopsy are needed to diagnose CTD-ILD, whereas both non-invasive and invasive assessments of pulmonary hemodynamics are needed to diagnose pulmonary hypertension. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment for ILD, although data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatments are lacking. Furthermore, treatment strategies vary according to the clinical situation-for example, the treatment of a patient newly diagnosed as having CTD-ILD differs from that of someone with an acute exacerbation of the disease. Immunosuppression is indicated only in select cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension related to CTD; more commonly, selective pulmonary vasodilators are used. For both diseases, comorbidities such as sleep disordered breathing, symptoms of dyspnea, and cough should be evaluated and treated. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with advanced disease but is not always feasible because of other manifestations of CTD and comorbidities. Clinical trials of novel therapies including immunosuppressive therapies are needed to inform best treatment strategies.","author":[{"family":"Mathai","given":"Stephen C."},{"family":"Danoff","given":"Sonye K."}],"citation-key":"Mathai2016a","container-title":"BMJ (Online)","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.h6819","ISSN":"17561833","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"PMID":"26912511","title":"Management of interstitial lung disease associated with connective tissue disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"352"},
  {"id":"Matta1976","abstract":"The effect of psychologic stress on cardiac vulnerability was examined in 10 conscious dogs. The repetitive extrasystole threshold wasemployed as a measure of susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. Instrumental aversive conditioning constituted a stressful environment. The repetitive extrasystole threshold decreased by nearly 50 percent during 3 days in which the animals were exposed to the stressful environment. When Tolamolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered before a stress session, the repetitive extra-systole threshold was unaltered from the control value. Thus, stress-evoked changes in cardiac vulnerabilityare mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. The role of psychologic stress in predisposing to cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized clinically. However, precise data documenting this relation have been difficult to obtain in man or in the animal laboratory. With growing interest in the problem of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation, attention has been devoted to alterations in ventricular vulnerability during various stressful states. Recently it has been demonstrated in dogs that the threshold of the ventricular vulnerable period for eliciting repetitive extrasystoles is significantly lower in an aversive than in a placid environment. 1 It has also been found that animals placed in stressful restraint after myocardial infarction experience ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. 2 In pigs protected against psychologic stress, the onset of ventricular fibrillation after coronary arterial ligation is either retarded or entirely prevented, u Moreover, pharmacologically restrained pigs subjected to electrical stimulation undergo severe acute cardiomyopathy and 13 percent die suddenly. 4 This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of psychologic stress upon ventricular electrical stability in the conscious dog. The assumption entertained was that a change in cardiac electrical stability was associated with increased susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation. 5 The underlying hypothesis was that a psychologically stressful environment would increase cardiac electrical instability. Instrumental aversive conditioning was the experimental paradigm employed to produce psychologic stress. 6-s Since certain types of stressors in man affect cardiac function through sympathetic nervous mediation, 9 these studies were performed with and without blockade of beta adrenergic activity. Cardiac electrical stability was determined by measuring the threshold current necessary to provoke repetitive ventricular extrasystoles. It has been demonstrated that the repetitive extrasystole threshold can be used as a precise measure of the vulnerable period threshold for ventricular fibrillation.I, lo Methods Ten mongrel dogs, weighing 8.5 to 17 kg, were anesthetized with intravenously administered sodium pentobarbital, 32.5 mg/kg body weight.

  {"id":"Matthews1985","abstract":"The steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of β-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient β-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and β-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p < 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p < 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p < 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient β-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p < 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p < 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31% for insulin resistance and 32% for β-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.","author":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"D.

  {"id":"McDonald2014","abstract":"Heart rate and peripheral blood flow distribution are the primary determinants of the rate and pattern of oxygen store utilisation and ultimately breath-hold duration in marine endotherms. Despite this, little is known about how otariids (sea lions and fur seals) regulate heart rate (fH) while diving. We investigated dive fH in five adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) during foraging trips by instrumenting them with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) loggers and time depth recorders. In all dives, dive fH (number of beats/duration; 50±9 beats min−1) decreased compared with surface rates (113±5 beats min−1), with all dives exhibiting an instantaneous fH below resting (&lt;54 beats min−1) at some point during the dive. Both dive fH and minimum instantaneous fH significantly decreased with increasing dive duration. Typical instantaneous fH profiles of deep dives (&gt;100 m) consisted of: (1) an initial rapid decline in fH resulting in the lowest instantaneous fH of the dive at the end of descent, often below 10 beats min−1 in dives longer than 6 min in duration; (2) a slight increase in fH to ~10–40 beats min−1 during the bottom portion of the dive; and (3) a gradual increase in fH during ascent with a rapid increase prior to surfacing. Thus, fH regulation in deep-diving sea lions is not simply a progressive bradycardia. Extreme bradycardia and the presumed associated reductions in pulmonary and peripheral blood flow during late descent of deep dives should (a) contribute to preservation of the lung oxygen store, (b) increase dependence of muscle on the myoglobin-bound oxygen store, (c) conserve the blood oxygen store and (d) help limit the absorption of nitrogen at depth. This fH profile during deep dives of sea lions may be characteristic of deep-diving marine endotherms that dive on inspiration as similar fH profiles have been recently documented in the emperor penguin, another deep diver that dives on inspiration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"McDonald","given":"Birgitte I."},{"family":"Ponganis","given":"Paul J."}],"citation-key":"McDonald2014","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.098558","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"page":"1525-1534","source":"Silverchair","title":"Deep-diving sea lions exhibit extreme bradycardia in long-duration dives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.098558","volume":"217"},

Among the patients assigned to preoperative coronary-artery revascularization, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 59 percent, and bypass surgery was performed in 41 percent. The median time from randomization to vascular surgery was 54 days in the revascularization group and 18 days in the group not undergoing revascularization (P<0.001). At 2.7 years after randomization, mortality in the revascularization group was 22 percent and in the no-revascularization group 23 percent (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). Within 30 days after the vascular operation, a postoperative myocardial infarction, defined by elevated troponin levels, occurred in 12 percent of the revascularization group and 14 percent of the no-revascularization group (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery does not significantly alter the long-term outcome. On the basis of these data, a strategy of coronary-artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery among patients with stable cardiac symptoms cannot be recommended.

  {"id":"McGrail2017","abstract":"Introduction: Many rural communities continue to experience an undersupply of primary care doctor services. While key professional factors relating to difficulties of recruitment and retention of rural primary care doctors are widely identified, less attention has been given to the role of community and place aspects on supply. Place-related attributes contribute to a community's overall amenity or attractiveness, which arguably influence both rural recruitment and retention relocation decisions of doctors. This bi-national study of Australia and the USA, two developed nations with similar geographic and rural access profiles, investigates the extent to which variations in community amenity indicators are associated with spatial variations in the supply of rural primary care doctors. Methods: Measures from two dimensions of community amenity: geographic location, specifically isolation/proximity; and economics and sociodemographics were included in this study, along with a proxy measure (jurisdiction) of a third dimension, environmental amenity. Data were chiefly collated from the American Community Survey and the Australian Census of Population and Housing, with additional calculated proximity measures. Rural primary care supply was measured using provider-to-population ratios in 1949 US rural counties and in 370 Australian rural local government areas. Additionally, the more sophisticated two-step floating catchment area method was used to measure Australian rural primary care supply in 1116 rural towns, with population sizes ranging from 500 to 50 000. Associations between supply and community amenity indicators were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficients and ordinary least squares multiple linear regression models. Results: It was found that increased population size, having a hospital in the county, increased house prices and affluence, and a more educated and older population were all significantly associated with increased workforce supply across rural areas of both countries. While remote areas were strongly linked with poorer supply in Australia, geographical remoteness was not significant after accounting for other indicators of amenity such as the positive association between workforce supply and coastal location. Workforce supply in the USA was negatively associated with fringe rural area locations adjacent to larger metropolitan areas and characterised by long work commutes. The US model captured 49% of the variation of workforce supply between rural counties, while the Australian models captured 35-39% of rural supply variation. Conclusions: These data support the idea that the rural medical workforce is maldistributed with a skew towards locating in more affluent and educated areas, and against locating in smaller, poorer and more isolated rural towns, which struggle to attract an adequate supply of primary care services. This evidence is important in understanding the role of place characteristics and rural population dynamics in the recruitment and retention of rural doctors. Future primary care workforce policies need to place a greater focus on rural communities that, for a variety of reasons, may be less attractive to doctors looking to begin or remain working there.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McGrail","given":"M.

  {"id":"McGrail2017a","abstract":"PURPOSE Despite considerable investment in increasing the number of primary care physicians in rural shortage areas, little is known about their movement rates and factors influencing their mobility. We aimed to characterize geographic mobility among rural primary care physicians, and to identify location and individual factors that influence such mobility. METHODS Using data from the American Medical Association Physician Mas-terfile for each clinically active US physician, we created seven 2-year (biennial) mobility periods during 2000-2014. These periods were merged with county-level “rurality,” physician supply, economic characteristics, key demographic measures, and individual physician characteristics. We computed (1) mobility rates of physicians by rurality; (2) linear regression models of county-level rural nonreten-tion (departure); and (3) logit models of physicians leaving rural practice. RESULTS Biennial turnover was about 17% among physicians aged 45 and younger, compared with 9% among physicians aged 46 to 65, with little difference between rural and metropolitan groups. County-level physician mobility was higher for counties that lacked a hospital (absolute increase = 5.7%), had a smaller population size, and had lower primary care physician supply, but area-level economic and demographic factors had little impact. Female physicians (odds ratios = 1.24 and 1.46 for those aged 45 or younger and those aged 46 to 65, respectively) and physicians born in a metropolitan area (odds ratios = 1.75 and 1.56 for those aged 45 or younger and those aged 46 to 65, respectively) were more likely to leave rural practice. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide national-level evidence of rural physician mobility rates and factors associated with both county-level retention and indi-vidual-level departures. Outcomes were notably poorer in the most remote locations and those already having poorer physician supply and professional support. Rural health workforce planners and policymakers must be cognizant of these key factors to more effectively target retention policies and to take into account the additional support needed by these more vulnerable communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McGrail","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Wingrove","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Petterson","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Bazemore","given":"Andrew W."}],"citation-key":"McGrail2017a","container-title":"Annals of Family Medicine","DOI":"10.1370/afm.2096","ISSN":"15441717","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"322-328","publisher":"Annals of Family Medicine, Inc","title":"Mobility of US rural primary care physicians during 2000-2014","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"McMahon1996","abstract":"This research was designed to compare coronary, carotid and aortic arch baroreceptors in terms of the ranges of pressures required to elicit reflex vascular responses and the possible differences between the responses to pulsatile and non-pulsatile stimuli. Dogs were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, artificially ventilated and the chests opened wide. A perfusion circuit allowed independent control of pressures distending the three baroreceptor regions. A cardiopulmonary bypass and ventricular fibrillation prevented cardiac pulsations from influencing coronary baroreceptor pressure. The caudal region of the animal was perfused at constant flow and vascular resistance responses were assessed from changes in perfusion pressure. Only tests in which the overall response exceeded 3 kPa (22.5 mmHg) were analyzed. Reflex responses were obtained to significantly lower coronary pressures than were required to induce responses from other regions. The inflexion points of the stimulus-response curves for pulsatile coronary, carotid and aortic pressures were 10.5 +/- 0.6, 15.5 +/- 1.8 and 16.4 +/- 1.7 kPa (79 +/- 5, 116 +/- 14 and 123 +/- 13 mmHg, respectively; values are means +/- S.E.M.). When the responses to pulsatile stimuli were compared with those to non-pulsatile stimuli, it was noted that for the carotid receptors, lower pressures were required to induce responses (inflexion pressure less) and the slope of the stimulus-response curve was less. Pulsatile aortic pressures induced a parallel (downward) displacement of the curve but no change in inflexion point or slope. The coronary baroreceptor stimulus-response relationship was unaffected by pulsatility. These results show differences between the characteristics of the three baroreceptors with coronary receptors being unaffected by pressure pulsatility but likely to be of importance in hypotensive situations.","author":[{"family":"McMahon","given":"N.

Because of the large number of genes and alleles attributed to DCM, comprehensive genetic testing encompasses ever-increasing gene panels. Genetic diagnosis can help predict prognosis, especially with regard to arrhythmia risk for certain subtypes. Moreover, cascade genetic testing in family members can identify those who are at risk or with early stage disease, offering the opportunity for early intervention. This review will address diagnosis and management of DCM, including the role of genetic evaluation. We will also overview distinct genetic pathways linked to DCM and their pathogenetic mechanisms. Historically, cardiac morphology has been used to classify cardiomyopathy subtypes. Determining genetic variants is emerging as an additional adjunct to help further refine subtypes of DCM, especially where arrhythmia risk is increased, and ultimately contribute to clinical management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"McNally","given":"Elizabeth M."},{"family":"Mestroni","given":"Luisa"}],"citation-key":"McNally2017","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309396","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,15]]},"page":"731-748","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Dilated Cardiomyopathy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circresaha.116.309396","volume":"121"},

  {"id":"Mebazaa2007","abstract":"Context: Because acute decompensated heart failure causes substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a need for agents that at least improve hemodynamics and relieve symptoms without adversely affecting survival. Objective: To assess the effect of a short-term intravenous infusion of levosimendan or dobutamine on long-term survival. Design, Setting, and Patients: The Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support (SURVIVE) study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan or dobutamine in 1327 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure who required inotropic support. The trial was conducted at 75 centers in 9 countries and patients were randomized between March 2003 and December 2004. Interventions: Intravenous levosimendan (n=664) or intravenous dobutamine (n=663). Main Outcome Measure: All-cause mortality at 180 days. Results: All-cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 173 (26%) patients in the levosimendan group and 185 (28%) patients in the dobutamine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.13; P=.40). The levosimendan group had greater decreases in B-type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group (P<.001 for all time points). There were no statistical differences between treatment groups for the other secondary end points (all-cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours, and cardiovascular mortality at 180 days). There was a higher incidence of cardiac failure in the dobutamine group. There were higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, and headache in the levosimendan group. Conclusion: Despite an initial reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days or affect any secondary clinical outcomes.

  {"id":"Medvedovsky2020","abstract":"Introduction: Cardiac involvement is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in primary light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The electrocardiographic spatial QRS-T angle reflects changes in the direction of the repolarization sequence and is a powerful predictor of outcome in patients with heart failure. We examined the significance of the frontal QRS-T angle in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis. Methods: Forty-three consecutive patients with cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis were studied. Patients were followed for survival. Results: Patient median age was 62 years, 56% were males. After a median follow up of 56 months, 16 out of 43 patients had died (37%). The median QRS-T angle was 102° (interquartile range 35–148). QRS-T angle>102° was associated with increased prevalence of lambda free light chain disease and the presence of a pleural effusion. It was also associated with increased interventricular septum thickness, smaller left ventricle end-diastolic diameter, echocardiographic myocardial sparkling texture, pericardial effusion, elevated NT-Pro-BNP and increased restrictive physiology evident by increased E/A and E/e`. A QRS-T angle>102° was a significant predictor of increased mortality by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (71.6 ± 11.1% vs. 45.7 ± 11.1%, P = .02). A QRS-T angle>102° was an independent predictor of mortality by Cox regression analysis (HR 3.00, 95% CI 1.01–8.89, P < .05).

  {"id":"Meijer2011","abstract":"Objective: A meta-analysis of over 25 years of research into the relationship between post-myocardial infarction (MI) depression and cardiac prognosis was conducted to investigate changes in this association over time and to investigate subgroup effects. Method: A systematic literature search was performed (Medline, Embase and PsycINFO; 1975-2011) without language restrictions. Studies investigating the impact of post-MI depression on cardiovascular outcome, defined as all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and cardiac events within 24 months after the index MI, were identified. Depression had to be assessed within 3 months after MI using established instruments. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. Results: A total of 29 studies were identified, resulting in 41 comparisons. Follow-up (on average 16 months) was described for 16,889 MI patients. Post-MI depression was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [(OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.93; P<.001], cardiac mortality (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.68-4.36; P<.001) and cardiac events (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85; P<.001). ORs proved robust in subgroup analyses but declined over the years for cardiac events.

Background. The data were needed to establish the mismatch between heart size and PR interval and QRS duration in mammals. Methods. In the waters off the coast of Newfoundland, in two humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) with an estimated weight of 30,000 kg a 1-lead ECG was recorded, enabling reliable assessment of P waves and QRS complexes. Results. It was found that both the PR interval (atrioventricular [AV] transmission time) and QRS duration (ventricular excitation) are extremely short for animals of this size. These findings are difficult, if not impossible, to explain on the basis of currently accepted electrophysiologic theories. However, the narrow QRS complex may be due to a very dense His-Purkinje network in the ventricular wall of whales. Alternative mechanisms that can explain the function of the mammalian AV node need to be considered and explored. Conclusions. The results of the study may be of value for the understanding of the ECG in humans. © 1992.","author":[{"family":"Meijler","given":"Frits L."},{"family":"Wittkampf","given":"Fred H.M."},{"family":"Brennen","given":"Kenneth R."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Verne"},{"family":"Wassenaar","given":"Claes"},{"family":"Bakken","given":"Earl E."}],"citation-key":"Meijler1992","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/0735-1097(92)90120-C","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"page":"475-479","PMID":"1634688","title":"Electrocardiogram of the humpback whale (Megaptera noaeangliae) with specific reference to atrioventricular transmission and ventricular excitation","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

Therapy for conditions that are associated with a risk of atrial fibrillation, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, obesity, and excessive alcohol consumption, may reduce the risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation. The presence or absence of risk factors for stroke is used to estimate the risk of stroke in order to determine whether anticoagulation is indicated for paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. When atrial fibrillation has been present for 48 hours or longer or for an unknown duration and elective cardioversion is planned, a period of anticoagulation before and after cardioversion is warranted, even when risk factors for stroke are absent. Uncontrolled tachycardia can lead to deterioration of left ventricular function. Attempts to maintain sinus rhythm should be considered when atrial fibrillation has not been persistent for more than 1 year or is paroxysmal and symptomatic.

  {"id":"Minassian2015","abstract":"IMPORTANCE Disrupted autonomic nervous system functioning as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is not clear, however, whether reduced HRV before trauma exposure contributes to the risk for development of PTSD. OBJECTIVE To examine whether HRV before combat deployment is associated with increased risk of a PTSD diagnosis after deployment when accounting for deployment-related combat exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between July 14, 2008, and May 24, 2012, active-duty Marines were assessed 1 to 2 months before a combat deployment and again 4 to 6 months after their return. The first phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-I) included 1415 male Marines, 59 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Participants in the second phase of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS-II) included 745 male Marines, 25 of whom developed PTSD after deployment. Analysis was conducted from November 25, 2013, to April 16, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Predeployment HRVwas measured via finger photoplethysmography during a 5-minute period of rest. Frequency-domain measures of HRV were generated. Diagnosis of PTSD was determined using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. RESULTS After accounting for deployment-related combat exposure, lower HRV before deployment as measured by an increased low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) ratio of HRV was associated with risk of PTSD diagnosis after deployment (combined MRS-I and MRS-II cohortmeta-analysis odds ratio, 1.47; 95%CI, 1.10-1.98; P = .01). The prevalence of postdeployment PTSD was higher in participants with high predeployment LF:HF ratios (15.8% [6 of 38 participants]) compared with participants who did not have high LF:HF ratios (3.7%[78 of 2122 participants]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This prospective longitudinal study provides initial and modest evidence that an altered state of autonomic nervous system functioning contributes to PTSD vulnerability, taking into account other key risk factors.

  {"id":"Minisi1991","abstract":"91284342 Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Minisi","given":"Anthony J"},{"family":"Thames","given":"Marc D"}],"citation-key":"Minisi1991","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.84.1.357","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",7]]},"page":"357-367","PMID":"2060106","title":"Activation of cardiac sympathetic afferents during coronary occlusion.

  {"id":"Minisi1993","abstract":"BACKGROUND Stimulation of left ventricular (LV) receptors with sympathetic afferents generally results in reflex sympathoexcitatory responses. Stimulation of LV receptors with vagal afferents results in reflex sympathoinhibitory responses. Vagal afferents are known to be preferentially distributed to the inferoposterior (IP) wall of the LV. We tested the hypothesis that there is also a preferential distribution of LV sympathetic afferents. METHODS AND RESULTS We measured reflex responses to stimulation of sympathetic afferents located in the anterior and IP LV: We used myocardial ischemia and chemical stimuli to increase the activity of the sensory endings in 15 chloralose-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. Reflex responses were assessed by direct recordings of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). In nine dogs, maximal RSNA changes elicited by transmural anterior myocardial ischemia (22.6 +/- 3.9% increase from baseline nerve traffic) were not significantly different from maximal RSNA changes observed during transmural IP ischemia (27.1 +/- 4.4%). Similar changes in mean arterial and left atrial pressures were noted during transmural anterior and IP ischemia. In eight dogs, maximal changes of RSNA elicited by epicardial or intracoronary bradykinin to the anterior LV were not significantly different from those observed during bradykinin to the IP LV (anterior epicardial bradykinin, 76.7 +/- 11.7%; IP epicardial bradykinin, 72.2 +/- 10.0%; anterior intracoronary bradykinin, 84.6 +/- 21.0%; IP intracoronary bradykinin, 88.8 +/- 17.3%).

  {"id":"Mittleman1995","abstract":"Background Many anecdotes and several uncontrolled case series have suggested that emotionally stressful events, and more specifically, anger, immediately precede and appear to trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction. However, controlled studies to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction after episodes of anger have not been reported. Methods and Results We interviewed 1623 patients (501 women) an average of 4 days after myocardial infarction. The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P<.05). Conclusions Episodes of anger are capable of triggering the onset of acute myocardial infarction, but aspirin may reduce this risk. A better understanding of the manner in which external events trigger the onset of acute cardiovascular events may lead to innovative preventive strategies aimed at severing the link between these external stressors and their pathological consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Mittleman","given":"Murray A"},{"family":"Maclure","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Sherwood","given":"Jane B"},{"family":"Mulry","given":"Richard P"},{"family":"Tofler","given":"Geoffrey H"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Sue C"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Benson","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Muller","given":"James E"}],"citation-key":"Mittleman1995","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.92.7.1720","ISBN":"0009-7322 (Print)\\r0009-7322 (Linking)","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",10,1]]},"page":"1720-1725","PMID":"7671353","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","title":"Triggering of acute myocardial infarction onset by episodes of anger","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671353","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"Moak2007","abstract":"Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to indicate cardiac autonomic function. High-frequency power relates to respiratory sinus arrhythmia and therefore to parasympathetic cardiovagal tone; however, the relationship of low-frequency (LF) power to cardiac sympathetic innervation and function has been controversial. Alternatively, LF power might reflect baro reflexive modulation of autonomic outflows. We studied normal volunteers and chronic autonomic failure syndrome patients with and without loss of cardiac noradrenergic nerves to examine the relationships of LF power with cardiac sympathetic innervation and baroreflex function. We compared LF power of HRV in patients with cardiac sympathetic denervation, as indicated by low myocardial concentrations of 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or low rates of norepinephrine entry into coronary sinus plasma (cardiac norepinephrine spillover) to values in patients with intact innervation, at baseline, during infusion of yohimbine, which increases exocytotic norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, or during infusion of tyramine, which increases non-exocytotic release. Baroreflex-cardiovagal slope (BRS) was calculated from the cardiac interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver. LF power was unrelated to myocardial 6-[F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity or cardiac norepinephrine spillover. In contrast, the log of LF power correlated positively with the log of BRS (r = 0.72, < 0.0001). Patients with a low BRS (‚â§3 msec/mm Hg) had low LF power, regardless of cardiac innervation. Tyramine and yohimbine increased LF power in subjects with normal BRS but not in those with low BRS. BRS at baseline predicted LF responses to tyramine and yohimbine. LF power reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Moak","given":"Jeffrey P."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"David S."},{"family":"Eldadah","given":"Basil A."},{"family":"Saleem","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Courtney"},{"family":"Pechnik","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Sharabi","given":"Yehonatan"}],"citation-key":"Moak2007","container-title":"Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.3949/ccjm.76.s2.11","ISBN":"1939-2869 (Electronic)\\r0891-1150 (Linking)","ISSN":"08911150","issue":"SUPPL.2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"S51-59","PMID":"19376985","title":"Supine low-frequency power of heart rate variability reflects baroreflex function, not cardiac sympathetic innervation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376985%5Cnhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376985?dopt=AbstractPlus","volume":"76"},
  {"id":"Moazzami2020","abstract":"Background: Psychological stress is a risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with coronary artery disease. Certain brain regions that control both emotional states and cardiac physiology may be involved in this relationship. The rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) is an important brain region that processes stress and regulates immune and autonomic functions. Changes in rmPFC activity with emotional stress (reactivity) may be informative of future risk for MACE. Methods: Participants with stable coronary artery disease underwent acute mental stress testing using a series of standardized speech/arithmetic stressors and simultaneous brain imaging with high-resolution positron emission tomography brain imaging. We defined high rmPFC activation as a difference between stress and control scans greater than the median value for the entire cohort. Interleukin-6 levels 90 minutes after stress, and high-frequency heart rate variability during stress were also assessed. We defined MACE as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Results: We studied 148 subjects (69% male) with mean±SD age of 62±8 years. After adjustment for baseline demographics, risk factors, and baseline levels of interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability, higher rmPFC stress reactivity was independently associated with higher interleukin-6 and lower high-frequency heart rate variability with stress. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 34 subjects (21.3%) experienced a MACE. Each increase of 1 SD in rmPFC activation with mental stress was associated with a 21% increase risk of MACE (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.37]). Stress-induced interleukin-6 and high-frequency heart rate variability explained 15.5% and 32.5% of the relationship between rmPFC reactivity and MACE, respectively. Addition of rmPFC reactivity to conventional risk factors improved risk reclassification for MACE prediction, and C-statistic improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P=0.03). Conclusions: Greater rmPFC stress reactivity is associated with incident MACE. Immune and autonomic responses to mental stress may play a contributory role.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Moazzami","given":"Kasra"},{"family":"Wittbrodt","given":"Matthew T."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Bruno B."},{"family":"Nye","given":"Jonathon A."},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Puja K."},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Brad D."},{"family":"Almuwaqqat","given":"Zakaria"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yan V."},{"family":"Raggi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Ernest V."},{"family":"Goetz","given":"Margarethe"},{"family":"Quyyumi","given":"Arshed A."},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 and followed up for a median of 6.0 (IQR, 5.6-6.0) years in MIPS and 4.6 (IQR, 3.8-5.3) years in MIMS2. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2022, to February 15, 2023.The rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated as the mean systolic blood pressure times the mean heart rate at rest. Rate-pressure product reactivity was calculated as the maximum RPP during a standardized mental stress test minus the RPP at rest.The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure.From the total of 938 individuals from the pooled cohort (mean [SD] age, 60.2 [10.1] years; 611 [65.1%] men), 631 participated in MIPS and 307 in MIMS2. A total of 373 individuals (39.8%) were Black, 519 (55.3%) were White, and 46 (4.9%) were of unknown race or ethnicity. The RPP increased by a mean (SD) of 77.1% (23.1%) during mental stress (mean [SD] absolute change, 5651 [2878]). For every SD decrease in RPP reactivity with mental stress, the adjusted hazard ratios for the primary and secondary end points were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04-1.72) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.06-1.56), respectively, in MIPS and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.06-1.97) and 1.21 (95% CI, 1.02-1.60), respectively, in MIMS2. In the pooled sample, when RPP reactivity to mental stress was added to a model including traditional clinical risk characteristics, model discrimination for adverse events improved (increase in C statistic of 5% for the primary end point; P = .009).In this cohort study of individuals with stable CAD, a blunted cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress was associated with adverse outcomes.

  {"id":"Mohr2001","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the use of antiplatelet agents, usually aspirin, in patients who have had an ischemic stroke, there is still a substantial rate of recurrence. Therefore, we investigated whether warfarin, which is effective and superior to aspirin in the prevention of cardiogenic embolism, would also prove superior in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a prior noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, we compared the effect of warfarin (at a dose adjusted to produce an international normalized ratio of 1.4 to 2.8) and that of aspirin (325 mg per day) on the combined primary end point of recurrent ischemic stroke or death from any cause within two years. RESULTS: The two randomized study groups were similar with respect to base-line risk factors. In the intention-to-treat analysis, no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in any of the outcomes measured. The primary end point of death or recurrent ischemic stroke was reached by 196 of 1103 patients assigned to warfarin (17.8 percent) and 176 of 1103 assigned to aspirin (16.0 percent; P=0.25; hazard ratio comparing warfarin with aspirin, 1.13; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.38). The rates of major hemorrhage were low (2.22 per 100 patient-years in the warfarin group and 1.49 per 100 patient-years in the aspirin group). Also, there were no significant treatment-related differences in the frequency of or time to the primary end point or major hemorrhage according to the cause of the initial stroke (1237 patients had had previous small-vessel or lacunar infarcts, 576 had had cryptogenic infarcts, and 259 had had infarcts designated as due to severe stenosis or occlusion of a large artery). CONCLUSIONS: Over two years, we found no difference between aspirin and warfarin in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke or death or in the rate of major hemorrhage. Consequently, we regard both warfarin and aspirin as reasonable therapeutic alternatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohr","given":"J.P."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"J.L.P."},{"family":"Lazar","given":"R.M."},{"family":"Levin","given":"B."},{"family":"Sacco","given":"R.L."},{"family":"Furie","given":"K.L."},{"family":"Kistler","given":"J.P."},{"family":"Albers","given":"G.W."},{"family":"Pettigrew","given":"L.C."},{"family":"Adams","given":"H.P."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"C.M."},{"family":"Pullicino","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Mohr2001","container-title":"New England Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1056/NEJMoa011258","ISBN":"0028-4793 (Print)\\n0028-4793 (Linking)","ISSN":"0028-4793","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"1444-1451","PMID":"11794192","title":"A Comparison of Warfarin and Aspirin for the Prevention of Recurrent Ischemic Stroke","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.nejm.org","volume":"345"},
  {"id":"Mølgaard1991","abstract":"Attenuated cardiac parasympathetic activity appear to be an important risk factor contributing to sudden cardiac death in subjects with overt coronary disease but its predictive value in otherwise healthy normal subjects is not known. We have for 8 years followed 260 apparently healthy adult subjects who underwent Holter monitoring. Twelve died, 14 developed ischaemic heart disease and four suffered sudden cardiac death. A healthy control subject was matched, along with other risk factors, for each case. In each subject 24-h heart rate variability was calculated as the deviation of all normal R-R intervals from mean R-R (SD) and the percentage of successive R-R interval differences exceeding 6% (%DIF6%)--this was used as an index of cardiac parasympathetic activity. There were no significant differences in heart rate variability between the cases developing problems and controls. In the sudden cardiac death victims, however, there was a clear trend towards lower heart rate variability. In them waketime mean SD was 73 ms versus 85 ms for cases and controls respectively (p = 0.08), and for sleeptime 61 ms versus 76 ms (p = 0.07). Compared to normal limits for heart rate variability obtained in 140 subjects that remained healthy for 8 years, figures for both SD and %DIF6% in sudden cardiac death subjects were at or below 95% confidence limits. The results indicate that altered autonomic balance may contribute to sudden cardiac death even in apparently healthy subjects. Subjects with a low 24-h heart rate variability on Holter monitoring may be predicted at an early stage of being at greater risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Mølgaard","given":"Henning"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Keld Ejvind"},{"family":"Bjerregaard","given":"Preben"}],"citation-key":"Mølgaard1991","container-title":"Clinical Autonomic Research","DOI":"10.1007/BF01824992","ISBN":"0959-9851 (Print)\\r0959-9851 (Linking)","ISSN":"09599851","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",9]]},"page":"233-237","PMID":"1822256","title":"Attenuated 24-h heart rate variability in apparently healthy subjects, subsequently suffering sudden cardiac death","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1822256","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Momose2001a","abstract":"The rich autonomic innervation of the heart plays an important role in modifying cardiovascular function. Recently developed in vivo scintigraphic imaging techniques allow for visualization of the autonomic innervation of the heart. Studies using the modalities have shown heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in various kinds of pathological conditions as well as normal human heart. The inferioposterior region shows typically less sympathetic innervation than the anterior region. In addition, neuropathic processes appear to commence in inferior-apical regions extending towards the base of the heart. Arrhythmogeneity has been related to the heterogeneous innervation of the heart and heterogeneous uptake of radiolabeled catecholamine analogues, such as I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, can be found in patients with arrhythmia. In dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced uptake indicates a poor prognosis which allows risk stratification for patients with heart failure. Heterogeneity of the reinnervation process following heart transplantation has also been investigated. Evidence was found of reinnervation primarily in the basal anterioseptal region and to a lesser degree in the inferioposterior and apical regions. Tracer approaches are uniquely suited to identify regionally altered innervation and provide tools for linking information on cardiac autonomic innervation with other clinical aspects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Momose","given":"Mitsuru"},{"family":"Tyndale-Hines","given":"Leisha"},{"family":"Bengel","given":"Frank Michael"},{"family":"Schwaiger","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"Momose2001a","container-title":"Basic Research in Cardiology","DOI":"10.1007/s003950170004","ISSN":"0300-8428","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",12,1]]},"page":"539-546","title":"How heterogeneous is the cardiac autonomic innervation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s003950170004","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"monnet1995","abstract":"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 200 microM) evokes the release of [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) from preloaded hippocampal slices. This effect is potentiated by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA S), whereas it is inhibited by pregnenolone sulfate (PREG S) and the high-affinity sigma inverse agonist 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine, at concentrations of > or = 100 nM. Neither 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one nor its sulfate ester modified NMDA-evoked [3H]NE overflow. The sigma antagonists haloperidol and 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine, although inactive by themselves, completely prevented the effects of DHEA S, PREG S, and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine on NMDA-evoked [3H]NE release. Progesterone (100 nM) mimicked the antagonistic effect of haloperidol and 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methyl-piperazine. These results indicate that the tested steroid sulfate esters differentially affected the NMDA response in vitro and suggest that DHEA S acts as a sigma agonist, that PREG S acts as a sigma inverse agonist, and that progesterone may act as a sigma antagonist. Pertussis toxin, which inactivates the Gi/o types of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi/o protein) function, suppresses both effects of DHEA S and PREG S. Since sigma 1 but not sigma 2 receptors are coupled to Gi/o proteins, the present results suggest that DHEA S and PREG S control the NMDA response via sigma 1 receptors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Monnet","given":"F P"},{"family":"Mahé","given":"V"},{"family":"Robel","given":"P"},{"family":"Baulieu","given":"E E"}],"citation-key":"monnet1995","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"Montrief2018","abstract":"Introduction: Acute liver failure (ALF) remains a high-risk clinical presentation, and many patients require emergency department (ED) management for complications and stabilization. Objective: This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of ALF. Discussion: While ALF remains a rare clinical presentation, surveillance data suggest an overall incidence between 1 and 6 cases per million people every year, accounting for 6% of liver-related deaths and 7% of orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) in the U.S. The definition of ALF includes neurologic dysfunction, an international normalized ratio ≥ 1.5, no prior evidence of liver disease, and a disease course of ≤26 weeks, and can be further divided into hyperacute, acute, and subacute presentations. There are many underlying etiologies, including acetaminophen toxicity, drug induced liver injury, and hepatitis. Emergency physicians will be faced with several complications, including encephalopathy, coagulopathy, infectious processes, renal injury, and hemodynamic instability. Critical patients should be evaluated in the resuscitation bay, and consultation with the transplant team for appropriate patients improves patient outcomes. This review provides several guiding principles for management of acute complications. Using a pathophysiological-guided approach to the management of ALF associated complications is essential to optimizing patient care. Conclusions: ALF remains a rare clinical presentation, but has significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians must rapidly diagnose these patients while evaluating for other diseases and complications. Early consultation with a transplantation center is imperative, as is identifying the underlying etiology and initiating symptomatic care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Montrief","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Koyfman","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Long","given":"Brit"}],"citation-key":"Montrief2018","container-title":"American Journal of Emergency Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.10.032","ISBN":"0735-6757","ISSN":"15328171","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"PMID":"30414744","title":"Acute liver failure: A review for emergency physicians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2018.10.032"},
  {"id":"Moranville2015","abstract":"AIMS: Sequential nephron blockade with thiazide-like diuretics is a strategy used to overcome diuretic resistance in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), but head-to-head studies are lacking and equipoise exists regarding the preferred thiazide-like diuretic in this setting. We thus compared the effectiveness of oral metolazone versus intravenous (IV) chlorothiazide as add-on therapy to loop diuretics in hospitalized patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral metolazone versus IV chlorothiazide as add-on therapy to loop diuretics in patients hospitalized with ADHF and renal dysfunction. The primary endpoint was net urine output (UOP) at 72 h after initiation of thiazide-like diuretics. Safety endpoints included worsening renal function, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled with 33 patients receiving metolazone and 22 patients receiving chlorothiazide. There was no difference in median net UOP at 72 h in those receiving metolazone (4828 mL, interquartile range [IQR] 2800-7209 mL) compared to chlorothiazide (3779 mL, IQR 1885-6535 mL) (P = 0.16). There was no difference in hypotension, worsening renal function, hyponatremia, or hypokalemia (P = NS for all comparisons). Hospital length of stay was shorter in the metolazone cohort (median 7 days) compared to chlorothiazide (median 15 days), suggesting the chlorothiazide cohort was likely sicker. CONCLUSION: Sequential nephron blockade with either metolazone or chlorothiazide appears to be efficacious and safe in ADHF, renal dysfunction, and diuretic resistance. Given the considerable cost difference favoring oral metolazone, larger randomized studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to exclude the possibility of confounding by indication.","author":[{"family":"Moranville","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Choi","given":"Suji"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Allen S."},{"family":"Rich","given":"Jonathan D."}],"citation-key":"Moranville2015","container-title":"Cardiovascular Therapeutics","DOI":"10.1111/1755-5922.12109","ISBN":"1755-5922 (Electronic)\\r1755-5914 (Linking)","ISSN":"17555922","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"42-49","PMID":"25712736","title":"Comparison of Metolazone Versus Chlorothiazide in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure with Diuretic Resistance","type":"article-journal","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"morris1997","abstract":"Neuropeptide Y coexists with norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves and is coreleased into the circulation on sympathetic activation. Little is known about the regional release of neuropeptide Y in humans under normal conditions or in pathophysiological situations of sympathetic activation or denervation. We measured plasma neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity and norepinephrine concentrations in samples taken from the brachial artery; coronary sinus; and internal jugular, antecubital, or hepatic veins in volunteers aged 20 to 64 years. Regional neuropeptide Y overflow at rest was calculated from venoarterial plasma concentration differences and plasma flow, and norepinephrine spillover was determined by [() H]norepinephrine infusion techniques. Cardiac release of neuropeptide Y and norepinephrine was examined in response to various stressors as well as in clinical models of sympathetic activation, cardiac failure, and denervation after cardiac transplantation. In healthy volunteers, cardiac, forearm, and jugular venous sample neuropeptide Y concentrations were similar to arterial levels. Hepatic vein plasma neuropeptide Y was greater than arterial both at rest (119 +/- 5% of arterial, n = 7) and after a meal (132 +/- 12%, n = 7), with neuropeptide Y overflows of 6 +/- 2 and 11 +/- 2 pmol/min, respectively. In contrast, hepatomesenteric norepinephrine spillover was not significantly increased by feeding. Although coronary sinus plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly with the cardiac sympathetic activation accompanying mental arithmetic, coffee drinking, isotonic exercise, and bicycle exercise, only the latter powerful sympathetic stimulus increased neuropeptide Y overflow. Cardiac failure was associated with increased resting release of both norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y from the heart, whereas postcardiac transplant norepinephrine spillover from the heart was reduced. The net overflow of neuropeptide Y to plasma observed at rest across the hepatic circulation, but not the cardiac, forearm, or cerebral circulations, indicates that the gut, the liver, or both make a major contribution to systemic plasma neuropeptide Y levels in humans. Sympathetic activation by exercise produced a modest increase in cardiac neuropeptide Y overflow but to only approximately 25% of the resting input from the gut and without a change in arterial neuropeptide Y concentration. Plasma neuropeptide Y measurements are less sensitive than those of plasma norepinephrine concentrations as an index for quantifying sympathetic neural responses regulating the systemic circulation.

  {"id":"Morrison2005","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Limited data illuminate how resident doctors view their important roles as teachers, supervisors and role models. Analysing qualitative data about resident teachers' self-perceptions can offer helpful insights. METHODS: One year after a randomised trial of a residents-as-teachers curriculum at a university medical centre, we invited its 23 resident participants to participate in semistructured interviews. We interviewed 21 third year residents from internal medicine, family medicine and paediatrics, including 12 intervention residents who had been randomly assigned to receive a 13-hour teacher training programme and 9 control residents who had received no training. We used grounded theory techniques. Two investigators independently content-analysed the transcribed interviews for emerging themes and we then developed a schema for a third investigator to code the transcripts. RESULTS: Three key themes consistently emerged: enthusiasm for teaching (current and future), learner-centredness, and self-knowledge about teaching. Compared with control residents, the intervention residents expressed greater enthusiasm for teaching, more learner-centred and empathic approaches, and a richer understanding of teaching principles and skills. Most intervention residents wanted to continue teaching during and after training. Fewer control residents enjoyed their current teaching, and fewer still wanted to teach in the future. The control residents seemed easily frustrated by time constraints and they often expressed cynicism and blame toward learners. DISCUSSION: One year after participating in a randomised trial of a residents-as-teachers curriculum, generalist residents revealed fairly consistent perceptions of their teaching roles.

  {"id":"Moss1996","abstract":"Background: Unsustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with previous myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction is associated with a two-year mortality rate of about 30 percent. We studied, whether prophylactic therapy with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, as compared with conventional medical therapy, would improve survival in this high-risk group of patients. Methods: Over the course of five years, 196 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I, II, or III with prior myocardial infarction; a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.35; a documented episode of asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia; and inducible, nonsuppressible ventricular tachyarrhythmia on electrophysiologic study were randomly assigned to receive an implanted defibrillator (n=95) or conventional medical therapy (n= 101).

Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive an implantable defibrillator (742 patients) or conventional medical therapy (490 patients). Invasive electrophysiological testing for risk stratification was not required. Death from any cause was the end point. RESULTS The clinical characteristics at base line and the prevalence of medication use at the time of the last follow-up visit were similar in the two treatment groups. During an average follow-up of 20 months, the mortality rates were 19.8 percent in the conventional-therapy group and 14.2 percent in the defibrillator group. The hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in the defibrillator group as compared with the conventional-therapy group was 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.93; P=0.016).

The aim of this study was to determine whether brief episodes of anger trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndromes (ACS), ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and ventricular arrhythmia.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating whether outbursts of anger are associated with the short-term risk of heart attacks, strokes, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm that occur in everyday life.

The systematic review included nine independent case-crossover studies of anger outbursts and MI/ACS (four studies), ischaemic stroke (two studies), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (one study), and ventricular arrhythmia (two studies). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 92.5% for MI/ACS and 89.8% for ischaemic stroke).

  {"id":"Mrdutt2016","abstract":"Purpose: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in newborns. NEC’s relationship with poor neurocognitive outcomes is established; however additional longitudinal outcomes remain limited, especially for non-surgical NEC. This study explores the association of NEC with longitudinal gastrointestinal morbidity and growth outcomes. Methods: Retrospective matched cohort study of newborns admitted to a level 3 NICU (2008-2011) was performed. Babies diagnosed with NEC and controls matched on birthweight and gestational age were included. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed. Primary outcomes included long-term gastrointestinal diagnoses (GI-Dx; ie: abdominal pain, intestinal gas, jaundice, feeding intolerance, constipation, hernias, ostomy care) recorded at subsequent encounters following NICU discharge. Logistic regression models were developed to examine which demographic and clinical variables were associated with these outcomes. Results: 260 neonates were included: 130 with NEC, 130 controls. Of the NEC cases, 81% (n=105) were Bell’s stage 1, and 19% (n=25) were stage 2 or 3. Similar percent of control and NEC infants exceeded the 25th growth percentile for height (58% vs. 63%) and weight (64% vs. 53%). In multivariable analysis, history of NEC (OR 5.42 [2.10, 13.98]) was significantly associated with presence of long-term medical GI-Dx. Higher morbidity in NICU was associated with long-term surgical GI-Dx. Conclusion: Neonates diagnosed with NEC exhibit increased medical gastrointestinal morbidity in long- term follow-up. Growth outcomes are comparable between NICU graduates with and without NEC. Data analysis for this study is ongoing to include babies born 1989-2007 (~650 additional patients) to improve power and further investigate outcomes over an even longer term.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Anish S"},{"family":"Mrdutt","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Mallett","given":"Lea"},{"family":"Perger","given":"Lena"},{"family":"Mrdutt","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Perger","given":"Lena"}],"citation-key":"Mrdutt2016","container-title":"Texas A & M University College of Medicine Research Symposium","event-place":"Temple, TX","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher":"Texas A&M University","publisher-place":"Temple, TX","title":"Long-Term Outcomes of Newborns with Necrotizing Enterocolitis: a retrospective matched cohort study","type":"paper-conference"},

Ninety one patients (61%) had a total of 598 episodes of significant ST segment change, of which 446 (75%) were asymptomatic. Twenty seven patients (18%) had only painless episodes; 14 (9%) patients only painful episodes; 50 patients (33%) had both painless and painful episodes. The mean number of ST segment changes per day was 2.58 (1.95 silent); however, 11 patients (7%) had 50% of all silent episodes, and 48 patients (32%) had 91% of all silent episodes. Fifty nine patients (39%) had no ST segment changes on ambulatory monitoring, and 73 patients (49%) had no evidence of silent ischaemia. Episodes ofsilent ischaemia occurred with a similar circadian distribution to that of painful ischaemia, predominantly between 0730 and 1930. There was a similar mean rise in heart rate at the onset of both silent and painful episodes ofischaemia. Silent ischaemia was significantly more frequent in patients with three vessel disease than in those with single vessel disease, and was also significantly related to both time to 1 mm ST depression and maximal exercise duration on exercise testing. There was a highly significant relation between the mean number and duration of episodes of silent ischaemia in patients with positive exercise tests when compared with those with negative tests.

Fresh rat brain slices (300 μm thick) were incubated with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 36°C, during which serial two- dimensional images of [18F]FDG uptake in the slices were constructed on the imaging plates. The net influx constant (=K) of [18F]FDG was determined by a Patlak graphical method of the image data. Prior to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-loading, the K value in the neurologically symptomatic PT was higher in all brain regions except the thalamus and mammillary body than the control, suggesting compensatory enhanced glycolysis. The rapid decrease in this heightened net influx constant immediately after TPP-loading was surmised to be due to activation of pyruvate oxidation with lactate as the substrate, with this inhibiting the glycolysis. From ≥150 min after TPP-loading, the K value continued to show low values in the thalamus and mammillary body, which are regarded as the responsible sites for Korsakoff syndrome, whereas in all other sites recovery to control values was observed. These findings suggest that using this technique the quantitative evaluation of serial local changes in CMRglc from thiamine deficiency to after its replenishment may be useful in elucidating the pathophysiology and prognosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Murata","given":"Tetsuhito"},{"family":"Omata","given":"Naoto"},{"family":"Fujibayashi","given":"Yasuhisa"},{"family":"Waki","given":"Atsuo"},{"family":"Sadato","given":"Norihiro"},{"family":"Yoshimoto","given":"Mitsuyoshi"},{"family":"Omori","given":"Masao"},{"family":"Isaki","given":"Kiminori"},{"family":"Yonekura","given":"Yoshiharu"}],"citation-key":"Murata1999a","container-title":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/S0022-510X(99)00055-6","ISBN":"0022-510X (Print)\\r0022-510X (Linking)","ISSN":"0022510X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,15]]},"page":"29-36","PMID":"10385044","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Dynamic changes in glucose metabolism induced by thiamine deficiency and its replenishment as revealed by a positron autoradiography technique using rat living brain slices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/science/article/pii/S0022510X99000556?via%3Dihub","volume":"164"},
  {"id":"Murphree1988","abstract":"beta 2-Receptors constitute only 10-30% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors in mammalian ventricular myocardium, but their precise tissue location cannot be determined easily by measuring physiological variables. To delineate the distribution of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components of the heart, we incubated transmural sections of canine left ventricle with [125Iodo]cyanopindolol and selected concentrations of the beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol or the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Detailed competition binding data were best accounted for by a two-site model in which approximately 75% of total sites were beta 1- and 25% were beta 2-receptors. The relative proportions of beta-receptor subtypes in myocytic and vascular components were assessed autoradiographically by analyzing the density of binding sites in transmural sections incubated with radioligand and subtype-selective displacers. Betaxolol (10(-7) M) reduced the density of radioligand binding sites by 44% in regions composed primarily of ventricular myocytes but by less than 5% in small coronary arterioles. ICI 118,551 (10(-7) M) reduced radioligand binding-site density by 18% in myocytic regions and by 55% in small arterioles. In myocytic regions, these data indicated a subtype composition of approximately 85% beta 1- and 15% beta 2-sites. In contrast, arterioles contained almost exclusively the beta 2-subtype. The diameters of coronary vessels in which beta 2-receptors were found to be selectively increased fell within a narrow range (mean +/- SD, 35 +/- 11 microns; range, 16-55 microns). Small mural arteries and venules did not contain a significantly higher proportion of beta 2-receptors than adjacent myocytic regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Murphree","given":"S S"},{"family":"Saffitz","given":"J E"}],"citation-key":"Murphree1988","container-title":"Circulation research","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",7]]},"page":"117-25","PMID":"2838202","title":"Delineation of the distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in canine myocardium.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2838202","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"Myhre2018","abstract":"Introduction: In Canada, rural-based family medicine residency programs were established largely in response to a shortage of rural physicians and the perception that urban-based training programs were not meeting the needs of rural populations. Examinations of practice patterns of physicians trained in rural and urban programs are lacking. The purpose of this study was to compare the scope of practice of family medicine graduates who completed a rural versus an urban residency program, by practice location. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, mail-out, questionnaire survey of 651 graduates who had completed the family medicine residency program at the University of Alberta or the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada during 2006-2011. Rural program graduates lived and trained in regional settings and spent a considerable amount of time in smaller rural and remote communities for their clinical experience. The training of urban program graduates was primarily based in large urban settings and family medicine clinical experience was based in the community. Practice location (rural, urban) was classified by population size of the town/city at which physicians practiced. Scope of practice was ascertained through four domains of care: types of care, clinical procedures, practice settings and specific populations. Items within each domain were rated on a five-point scale (1='not part of practice', 5='element of core practice'). Mean rating scores for items in the domains of care were compared between urban and rural program graduates using ANOVA. Results: A total of 307 (47.2%) graduates responded to the survey, of whom 173 were categorized as urban program graduates and 59 as rural program graduates. Overall, rural program graduates exhibited a broader scope of practice in providing postnatal care, intrapartum care/deliveries, palliative care, office-based and in-hospital clinical procedures, emergency care, in-hospital care, home visits, long-term care, and caring for rural and Aboriginal populations. Irrespective of program completed, those in a rural practice location had a broader scope of practice than those in urban practice. Urban and rural program graduates in rural locations tended to have a similar scope of practice. In urban locations, rural program graduates were more likely to include intrapartum care/deliveries as part of their clinical practice. Rural program graduates were more likely to practice in rural locations than urban program graduates. Conclusion: A combination of site of training (rural or urban program) and location of practice appear to work together to influence scope of practice of family physicians. A conceptual framework that summarizes the factors that have been reported to be associated with the scope of family practice is proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Myhre","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Szafran","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Schipper","given":"Shirley"},{"family":"Dickinson","given":"James"},{"family":"Janke","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"Myhre2018","container-title":"Rural and Remote Health","DOI":"10.22605/RRH4514","ISSN":"14456354","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"ARHEN - Australian Rural Health Education Network Ltd","title":"Scope of practice of family medicine graduates who completed a rural versus urban program","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

Current approaches to define specific HF subpopulations may fail to account for the diversity of etiologies, comorbidities, and factors driving disease progression, and therefore have limited value for clinical decision making and development of novel therapies. Here we present a novel and data-driven approach to understand and characterize the real-world manifestation of HF by clustering disease and symptom-related clinical concepts (complaints) captured from unstructured electronic health record clinical notes. We used natural language processing to construct vectorized representations of patient complaints followed by clustering to group HF patients by similarity of complaint vectors. We then identified complaints that were significantly enriched within each cluster using statistical testing. Breaking the HF population into groups of similar patients revealed a clinically interpretable hierarchy of subgroups characterized by similar HF manifestation. Importantly, our methodology revealed well-known etiologies, risk factors, and comorbid conditions of HF (including ischemic heart disease, aortic valve disease, atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, various cardiomyopathies, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease) and yielded additional insights into the details of each HF subgroup’s clinical manifestation of HF.

  {"id":"Nagashima2017","abstract":"In the estimation of Cox regression models, maximum partial likelihood estimates might be infinite in a monotone likelihood setting, where partial likelihood converges to a finite value and parameter estimates converge to infinite values. To address monotone likelihood, previous studies have applied Firth's bias correction method to Cox regression models. However, while the model selection criteria for Firth's penalized partial likelihood approach have not yet been studied, a heuristic AIC-type information criterion can be used in a statistical package. Application of the heuristic information criterion to data obtained from a prospective observational study of patients with multiple brain metastases indicated that the heuristic information criterion selects models with many parameters and ignores the adequacy of the model. Moreover, we showed that the heuristic information criterion tends to select models with many regression parameters as the sample size increases. Thereby, in the present study, we propose an alternative AIC-type information criterion based on the risk function. A Bayesian information criterion type was also evaluated. Further, the presented simulation results confirm that the proposed criteria performed well in a monotone likelihood setting. The proposed AIC-type criterion was applied to prospective observational study data.

Appropriate understanding and utilization of multimodality imaging is fundamental to accurate diagnosis as well as longitudinal care of patients with HCM. Resting and stress imaging provide comprehensive and complementary information to help clarify mechanism(s) responsible for symptoms such that appropriate and timely treatment strategies may be implemented.

  {"id":"Nair2012","abstract":"Background: Cardio-metabolic diseases (CMDs) are a growing public health problem, but data on incidence, trends, and costs in developing countries is scarce. Comprehensive and standardised surveillance for non-communicable diseases was recommended at the United Nations High-level meeting in 2011. Aims: To develop a model surveillance system for CMDs and risk factors that could be adopted for continued assessment of burdens from multiple perspectives in South-Asian countries. Methods. Design: Hybrid model with two cross-sectional serial surveys three years apart to monitor trend, with a three-year prospective follow-up of the first cohort. Sites: Three urban settings (Chennai and New Delhi in India; Karachi in Pakistan), 4000 participants in each site stratified by gender and age. Sampling methodology: Multi-stage cluster random sampling; followed by within-household participant selection through a combination of Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS) and Kish methods. Culturally-appropriate and methodologically-relevant data collection instruments were developed to gather information on CMDs and their risk factors; quality of life, health-care utilisation and costs, along with objective measures of anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters. The cohort follow-up is designed as a pilot study to understand the feasibility of estimating incidence of risk factors, disease events, morbidity, and mortality. Results: The overall participant response rate in the first cross-sectional survey was 94.1% (Chennai 92.4%, n=4943; Delhi 95.7%, n=4425; Karachi 94.3%, n=4016). 51.8% of the participants were females, 61.6%<45years, 27.5% 45-60years and 10.9% >60years. Discussion. This surveillance model will generate data on prevalence and trends; help study the complex life-course patterns of CMDs, and provide a platform for developing and testing interventions and tools for prevention and control of CMDs in South-Asia. It will also help understanding the challenges and opportunities in establishing a surveillance system across countries. © 2012 Nair et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Nair","given":"Manisha"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mohammed K."},{"family":"Ajay","given":"Vamadevan S."},{"family":"Shivashankar","given":"Roopa"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Viswanathan"},{"family":"Pradeepa","given":"Rajendra"},{"family":"Deepa","given":"Mohan"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Hassan M."},{"family":"Kadir","given":"Muhammad M."},{"family":"Fatmi","given":"Zafar A."},{"family":"Reddy","given":"K.

  {"id":"Narayan2011","abstract":"Background—\n\nThe substrates for human atrial fibrillation (AF) are poorly understood, but involve abnormal repolarization (action potential duration [APD]). We hypothesized that beat-to-beat oscillations in APD may explain AF substrates, and why vulnerability to AF forms a spectrum from control subjects without AF to patients with paroxysmal then persistent AF.\n\nMethods and Results—\n\nIn 33 subjects (12 with persistent AF, 13 with paroxysmal AF, and 8 controls without AF), we recorded left (n=33) and right (n=6) atrial APD on pacing from cycle lengths 600 to 500 ms (100 to 120 bpm) up to the point where AF initiated. Action potential duration alternans required progressively faster rates for patients with persistent AF, patients with paroxysmal AF, and controls (cycle length 411±94 versus 372±72 versus 218±33 ms; P<0.01). In AF patients, APD alternans occurred at rates as slow as 100 to 120 bpm, unrelated to APD restitution (P>0.10). In this milieu, spontaneous ectopy initiated AF. At fast rates, APD alternans disorganized to complex oscillations en route to AF. Complex oscillations also arose at progressively faster rates for persistent AF, paroxysmal AF, and controls (cycle length: 316±99 versus 266±19 versus 177±16 ms; P=0.02). In paroxysmal AF, APD oscillations amplified before AF (P<0.001). In controls, APD alternans arose only at very fast rates (cycle length <250 ms; P<0.001 versus AF groups) just preceding AF. In 4 AF patients in whom rapid pacing did not initiate AF, APD alternans arose transiently then extinguished.\n\nConclusions—\n\nAtrial APD alternans reveals dynamic substrates for AF, arising most readily (at lower rates and higher magnitudes) in persistent AF then paroxysmal AF, and least readily in controls. APD alternans preceded all AF episodes and was absent when AF did not initiate. The cellular mechanisms for APD alternans near resting heart rates require definition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Narayan","given":"Sanjiv M."},{"family":"Franz","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Clopton","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Pruvot","given":"Etienne J."},{"family":"Krummen","given":"David E."}],"citation-key":"Narayan2011","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.977827","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,28]]},"page":"2922-2930","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Repolarization Alternans Reveals Vulnerability to Human Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.977827","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"Narayan2012","abstract":"Introduction\nThe perpetuating mechanisms for human AF remain undefined. Localized rotors and focal beat sources may sustain AF in elegant animal models, but there has been no direct evidence for localized sources in human AF using traditional methods. We developed a clinical computational mapping approach, guided by human atrial tissue physiology, to reveal sources of human AF.\n\nMethods and Results\nIn 49 AF patients referred for ablation (62±9 years; 30 persistent), we defined repolarization dynamics using monophasic action potentials (MAP) and recorded AF activation from 64-pole basket catheters in left atrium and, in n=20 patients, in both atria. Careful positioning of basket catheters was required for optimal mapping. AF electrograms at 64-128 electrodes were combined with repolarization and conduction dynamics to construct spatiotemporal AF maps. We observed sustained sources in 47/49 patients, in the form of electrical rotors (n=57) and focal beats (n=11) that controlled local atrial activation with peripheral wavebreak (‘fibrillatory conduction’). Patients with persistent AF had more sources than those with paroxysmal AF (2.1±1.0 vs 1.5±0.8, p=0.02), related to shorter cycle length (163±19 vs 187±25 ms, p<0.001). Approximately one-quarter of sources lay in the right atrium.\n\nConclusions\nPhysiologically-guided computational mapping revealed sustained electrical rotors and repetitive focal beats during human AF for the first time. These localized sources were present in 96% of AF patients, and controlled AF activity. These results provide novel mechanistic insights into human AF and lay the foundation for mechanistically-tailored approaches to AF ablation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Narayan","given":"Sanjiv M."},{"family":"Krummen","given":"David E."},{"family":"Rappel","given":"Wouter-Jan"}],"citation-key":"Narayan2012","container-title":"Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology","container-title-short":"J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8167.2012.02332.x","ISSN":"1045-3873","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5]]},"page":"447-454","PMCID":"PMC3418865","PMID":"22537106","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Clinical Mapping Approach To Diagnose Electrical Rotors and Focal Impulse Sources for Human Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3418865/","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"Narayanan2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) diameter is routinely measured on the echocardiogram but has not been jointly evaluated with the ejection fraction (EF) for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS AND RESULTS: From a large ongoing community-based study of SCD (The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study; population approximately 1 million), SCD cases were compared with geographic controls. LVEF and LV diameter, measured using the LV internal dimension in diastole (categorized as normal, mild, moderate, or severe dilatation using American Society of Echocardiography definitions) were assessed from echocardiograms prior but unrelated to the SCD event. Cases (n=418; 69.5+/-13.8 years), compared with controls (n=329; 67.7+/-11.9 years), more commonly had severe LV dysfunction (EF </=35%; 30.5% versus 18.8%; P<0.01) and larger LV diameter (52.2+/-10.5 mm versus 49.7+/-7.9 mm; P<0.01). Moderate or severe LV dilatation (16.3% versus 8.2%; P=0.001) and severe LV dilatation (8.1% versus 2.1%; P<0.001) were significantly more frequent in cases. In multivariable analysis, severe LV dilatation was an independent predictor of SCD (odds ratio 2.5 [95% CI 1.03 to 5.9]; P=0.04). In addition, subjects with both EF </=35% and severe LV dilatation had higher odds for SCD compared with those with low EF only (odds ratio 3.8 [95% CI 1.5 to 10.2] for both versus 1.7 [95% CI 1.2 to 2.5] for low EF only), suggesting that severe LV dilatation additively increased SCD risk. CONCLUSION: LV diameter may contribute to risk stratification for SCD independent of the LVEF. This readily available echocardiographic measure warrants further prospective evaluation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Kumar"},{"family":"Reinier","given":"Kyndaron"},{"family":"Teodorescu","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Uy-Evanado","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Aleong","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Chugh","given":"Harpriya"},{"family":"Nichols","given":"Gregory A"},{"family":"Gunson","given":"Karen"},{"family":"London","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Jui","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Chugh","given":"Sumeet S"}],"citation-key":"Narayanan2014","container-title":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.114.001193","ISBN":"2047-9980","ISSN":"20479980","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"PMID":"25227407","title":"Left ventricular diameter and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"Nemati2018","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively.None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Nemati","given":"Shamim"},{"family":"Holder","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Razmi","given":"Fereshteh"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"Matthew D"},{"family":"Clifford","given":"Gari D"},{"family":"Buchman","given":"Timothy G"}],"citation-key":"Nemati2018","container-title":"Critical care medicine","DOI":"10.1097/CCM.0000000000002936","ISSN":"15300293","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"547-553","title":"An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Accurate Prediction of Sepsis in the ICU","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.sc2i.org,","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"Newton-Cheh2007a","abstract":"Background: Heritable electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measures, reflecting pacemaking, conduction, repolarization and autonomic function in the heart have been associated with risks for cardiac arrhythmias. Whereas several rare monogenic conditions with extreme phenotypes have been noted, few common genetic factors contributing to interindividual variability in ECG and HRV measures have been identified. We report the results of a community-based genomewide association study of six ECG and HRV intermediate traits. Methods: Genotyping using Affymetrix 100K GeneChip was conducted on 1345 related Framingham Heart Study Original and Offspring cohort participants. We analyzed 1175 Original and Offspring participants with ECG data (mean age 52 years, 52% women) and 548 Offspring participants with HRV data (mean age 48 years, 51% women), in relation to 70,987 SNPs with minor allele frequency ≥ 0.10, call rate ≥ 80%, Hardy-Weinberg p-value ≥ 0.001. We used generalized estimating equations to test association of SNP alleles with multivariable-adjusted residuals for QT, RR, and PR intervals, the ratio of low frequency to high frequency power (LF/HFP), total power (TP) and the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN). Results: Associations at p < 10-3 were found for 117 (QT), 105 (RR), 111 (PR), 102 (LF/HF), 121 (TP), and 102 (SDNN) SNPs. Several common variants in NOS1AP (4 SNPs with p-values < 10-3; lowest p-value, rs6683968, p = 1 × 10-4) were associated with adjusted QT residuals, consistent with our previously reported finding for NOS1AP in an unrelated sample of FHS Offspring and other cohorts. All results are publicly available at NCBI's dbGaP at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007. Conclusion: In the community-based Framingham Heart Study none of the ECG and HRV results individually attained genomewide significance. However, the presence of bona fide QT-associated SNPs among the top 117 results for QT duration supports the importance of efforts to validate top results from the reported scans.

Many of the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations have been reported to cause serious heart defects in humans (GATA4, MYH6, NKX2-5, PITX2, TBX5)1, or near genes important for striated muscle function and integrity (for example, CFL2, MYH7, PKP2, RBM20, SGCG, SSPN). Pathway and functional enrichment analyses also suggested that many of the putative atrial fibrillation genes act via cardiac structural remodeling, potentially in the form of an ‘atrial cardiomyopathy’2, either during fetal heart development or as a response to stress in the adult heart.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Jonas B."},{"family":"Thorolfsdottir","given":"Rosa B."},{"family":"Fritsche","given":"Lars G."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Skov","given":"Morten W."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Herron","given":"Todd J."},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Shane"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Ellen M."},{"family":"Sveinbjornsson","given":"Gardar"},{"family":"Surakka","given":"Ida"},{"family":"Mathis","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Masatoshi"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Ryan D."},{"family":"Gabrielsen","given":"Maiken E."},{"family":"Skogholt","given":"Anne Heidi"},{"family":"Holmen","given":"Oddgeir L."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Maoxuan"},{"family":"Wolford","given":"Brooke N."},{"family":"Dey","given":"Rounak"},{"family":"Dalen","given":"Håvard"},{"family":"Sulem","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Jonathan H."},{"family":"Backman","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Arnar","given":"David O."},{"family":"Thorsteinsdottir","given":"Unnur"},{"family":"Baras","given":"Aris"},{"family":"O’Dushlaine","given":"Colm"},{"family":"Holst","given":"Anders G."},{"family":"Wen","given":"Xiaoquan"},{"family":"Hornsby","given":"Whitney"},{"family":"Dewey","given":"Frederick E."},{"family":"Boehnke","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kheterpal","given":"Sachin"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Bhramar"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Seunggeun"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Hyun M."},{"family":"Holm","given":"Hilma"},{"family":"Kitzman","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Shavit","given":"Jordan A."},{"family":"Jalife","given":"José"},{"family":"Brummett","given":"Chad M."},{"family":"Teslovich","given":"Tanya M."},{"family":"Carey","given":"David J."},{"family":"Gudbjartsson","given":"Daniel F."},{"family":"Stefansson","given":"Kari"},{"family":"Abecasis","given":"Gonçalo R."},{"family":"Hveem","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Willer","given":"Cristen J."}],"citation-key":"Nielsen2018","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0171-3","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"9","page":"1234-1239","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Biobank-driven genomic discovery yields new insight into atrial fibrillation biology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0171-3","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"Niemeijer2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although sudden cardiac death (SCD) is relatively common, contemporary data on its incidence are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the current incidence of SCD and its trend over the past 2 decades in a general middle-aged and elderly population. METHODS: This study was performed within the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of persons aged 45 years and older. Age-standardized incidence rates of SCD were calculated. To study trends in incidence, we compared 2 subcohorts within the total study population, 1 followed from 1990-2000 and the other from 2001-2010. RESULTS: From 1990-2010, 5512 of 14,628 participants died, of whom 583 (4.0%) were classified as SCD. The overall incidence was 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence was higher in men (5.2 per 1000 person-years) than in women (3.6 per 1000 person-years). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95% confidence [CI] 1.56-2.17) and risk of SCD increased with age (HR 1.10 per year; 95% CI 1.09 -1.11). The incidence rate from 1990-2000 was 4.7 per 1000 person-years vs 2.1 per 1000 person-years from 2001-2010 (age- and sex-adjusted HR of SCD 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.80). To check for cohort effects, we also analyzed the incidence of total mortality and found an age- and sex-adjusted HR of total mortality of 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.90) for the second compared to the first subcohort, which was significantly higher than the decline in SCD incidence. CONCLUSION: We found an incidence of SCD of 4.2 per 1000 person-years. The incidence decreased from 1990-2010, a period during which the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease greatly improved.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Niemeijer","given":"Maartje N."},{"family":"Van Den Berg","given":"Marten E."},{"family":"Leening","given":"Maarten J.G."},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Oscar H."},{"family":"Deckers","given":"Jaap W."},{"family":"Heeringa","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Rijnbeek","given":"Peter R."},{"family":"Stricker","given":"Bruno H."},{"family":"Eijgelsheim","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Niemeijer2015","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.09.054","ISSN":"15563871","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,1]]},"page":"123-129","PMID":"25277989","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Declining incidence of sudden cardiac death from 1990-2010 in a general middle-aged and elderly population: The Rotterdam Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25277989/","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Nievergelt2015","abstract":"Background: Research on the etiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has rapidly matured, moving from candidate gene studies to interrogation of the entire human genome in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present the results of a GWAS performed on samples from combat-exposed U.S. Marines and Sailors from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS) scheduled for deployment to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. The MRS is a large, prospective study with longitudinal follow-up designed to identify risk and resiliency factors for combat-induced stress-related symptoms. Previously implicated PTSD risk loci from the literature and polygenic risk scores across psychiatric disorders were also evaluated in the MRS cohort. Methods: Participants (. N=. 3494) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale and diagnosed using the DSM-IV diagnostic criterion. Subjects with partial and/or full PTSD diagnosis were called cases, all other subjects were designated controls, and study-wide maximum CAPS scores were used for longitudinal assessments. Genomic DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array. Individual genetic ancestry was determined by supervised cluster analysis for subjects of European, African, Hispanic/Native American, and other descent. To test for association of SNPs with PTSD, logistic regressions were performed within each ancestry group and results were combined in meta-analyses. Measures of childhood and adult trauma were included to test for gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Polygenic risk scores from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium were used for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: The array produced >800K directly genotyped and >21M imputed markers in 3494 unrelated, trauma-exposed males, of which 940 were diagnosed with partial or full PTSD. The GWAS meta-analysis identified the phosphoribosyl transferase domain containing 1 gene (PRTFDC1) as a genome-wide significant PTSD locus (rs6482463; OR=1.47, SE=0.06, p=2.04×10-9), with a similar effect across ancestry groups. Association of PRTFDC1 with PTSD in an independent military cohort showed some evidence for replication. Loci with suggestive evidence of association (n=25 genes, p<5×10-6) further implicated genes related to immune response and the ubiquitin system, but these findings remain to be replicated in larger GWASs. A replication analysis of 25 putative PTSD genes from the literature found nominally significant SNPs for the majority of these genes, but associations did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. A cross-disorder analysis of polygenic risk scores from GWASs of BPD, MDD, and SCZ found that PTSD diagnosis was associated with risk sores of BPD, but not with MDD or SCZ. Conclusions: This first multi-ethnic/racial GWAS of PTSD highlights the potential to increase power through meta-analyses across ancestry groups. We found evidence for PRTFDC1 as a potential novel PTSD gene, a finding that awaits further replication. Our findings indicate that the genetic architecture of PTSD may be determined by many SNPs with small effects, and overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders, consistent with current findings from large GWAS of other psychiatric disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Nievergelt","given":"Caroline M."},{"family":"Maihofer","given":"Adam X."},{"family":"Mustapic","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Yurgil","given":"Kate A."},{"family":"Schork","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Logue","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Geyer","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Risbrough","given":"Victoria B."},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Baker","given":"Dewleen G."}],"citation-key":"Nievergelt2015","container-title":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.10.017","ISBN":"0306-4530","ISSN":"18733360","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1]]},"page":"459-471","PMID":"25456346","title":"Genomic predictors of combat stress vulnerability and resilience in U.S. Marines: A genome-wide association study across multiple ancestries implicates PRTFDC1 as a potential PTSD gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25456346","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"Niroshana2023","abstract":"Timely detection of anomalies and automatic interpretation of an electrocardiogram (ECG) play a crucial role in many healthcare applications, such as patient monitoring and post treatments. Beat-wise segmentation is one of the essential steps in ensuring the confidence and fidelity of many automatic ECG classification methods. In this sense, we present a reliable ECG beat segmentation technique using a CNN model with an adaptive windowing algorithm. The proposed adaptive windowing algorithm can recognise cardiac cycle events and perform segmentation, including regular and irregular beats from an ECG signal with satisfactorily accurate boundaries.The proposed algorithm was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively based on the annotations provided with the datasets and beat-wise manual inspection. The algorithm performed satisfactorily well for the MIT-BIH dataset with a 99.08% accuracy and a 99.08% of F1-score in detecting heartbeats along with a 99.25% of accuracy in determining correct boundaries. The proposed method successfully detected heartbeats from the European S-T database with a 98.3% accuracy and 97.4% precision. The algorithm showed 99.4% of accuracy and precision for Fantasia database. In summary, the algorithm’s overall performance on these three datasets suggests a high possibility of applying this algorithm in various applications in ECG analysis, including clinical applications with greater confidence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Niroshana","given":"S.

Patients with a clinical deficit that is disproportionately severe relative to the infarct volume may benefit from late thrombectomy. Methods We enrolled patients with occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between the severity of the clinical deficit and the infarct volume, with mismatch criteria defined according to age (<80 years or ≥80 years). Patients were randomly assigned to thrombectomy plus standard care (the thrombectomy group) or to standard care alone (the control group). The coprimary end points were the mean score for disability on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale (which ranges from 0 [death] to 10 [no symptoms or disability]) and the rate of functional independence (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating more severe disability) at 90 days. Results A total of 206 patients were enrolled; 107 were assigned to the thrombectomy group and 99 to the control group. At 31 months, enrollment in the trial was stopped because of the results of a prespecified interim analysis. The mean score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 5.5 in the thrombectomy group as compared with 3.4 in the control group (adjusted difference [Bayesian analysis], 2.0 points; 95% credible interval, 1.1 to 3.0; posterior probability of superiority, >0.999), and the rate of functional independence at 90 days was 49% in the thrombectomy group as compared with 13% in the control group (adjusted difference, 33 percentage points; 95% credible interval, 24 to 44; posterior probability of superiority, >0.999). The rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (6% in the thrombectomy group and 3% in the control group, P=0.50), nor did 90-day mortality (19% and 18%, respectively; P=1.00). Conclusions Among patients with acute stroke who had last been known to be well 6 to 24 hours earlier and who had a mismatch between clinical deficit and infarct, outcomes for disability at 90 days were better with thrombectomy plus standard care than with standard care alone.

  {"id":"Nolte2017a","abstract":"Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to 53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs (in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11, RGS6 and HCN4). Genetic risk scores account for 0.9 to 2.6% of the HRV variance. Significant genetic correlation is found for HRV with heart rate (-0.74<r g <-0.55) and blood pressure (-0.35<r g <-0.20).

  {"id":"Notarius1999","abstract":"The concept that spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) can estimate cardiac sympathetic nerve traffic in subjects with both normal and impaired left ventricular systolic function has not been validated against muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). We used coarse-graining spectral analysis to quantify the harmonic and non-harmonic, or fractal, components of HRV and to determine low-frequency (0.0-0.15 Hz; PL) and high-frequency (0.15-0.5Hz; PH) harmonic power. To test the hypothesis that MSNA and HRV representations of sympathetic nerve activity (PL and PL/PH) increase in parallel in heart failure, we recorded heart rate and MSNA during supine rest in 35 patients (age 52.4+/-2 years; mean+/-S. E.M.), with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 22+/-2%, and in 34 age-matched normal subjects. Power density was log10 transformed. Mean MSNA was 52.9+/-2.6 bursts/min in heart failure patients and 34.9+/-1.9 bursts/min in normal subjects (P<0.0001). In normal subjects, but not in heart failure patients, total power (PT) (r=-0.41; P=0.02) and fractal power (PF) (r=-0.36; P=0.04) were inversely related to age. In heart failure patients, total and fractal power were reduced (P<0.009 for both), and were inversely related to MSNA burst frequency (r=-0.55, P=0.001 and r=-0.60, P=0. 0003 respectively). In normal subjects, there was no relationship between MSNA and either PL or PH. In heart failure patients, as anticipated, PH was inversely related to MSNA (r=-0.41; P<0.02). However, PL was also inversely rather than directly related to MSNA (r=0.44 for 1/log10 PL; P<0.01). There was no relationship between other sympathetic (PL/PH) or parasympathetic (PH/PT) indices and MSNA in either heart failure patients or normal subjects. The lack of concordance between these direct and indirect estimates of sympathetic nervous system activity indicates that this component of HRV cannot be used for between-subject comparisons of central sympathetic nervous outflow. It is the absence of low-frequency power that relates most closely to sympathetic activation in heart failure.","author":[{"family":"Notarius","given":"C. F."},{"family":"Butler","given":"G.

The main scientific achievements of Langley are dealing with anatomy and physiology of the autonomic (vegetative) nervous system that he considered as an entirely efferent system. The autonomic nervous system was divided by Langley into three parts: sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteral (intestinal) systems. He has also established functional differences of the autonomic nervous system from the somatic one. He suggested the presence of synaptic contacts on muscle and secretory cells, as well as the existence in these synaptic structures of a peculiar receptor substance providing interaction of nerve fibers with postganglionic neurons and effector cells of visceral organs.

There are currently no normative data for short-term measures of HRV. A thorough review of short-term HRV data published since 1996 was therefore performed. Data from studies published after the 1996 Task Force report (i.e., between January 1997 and September 2008) and reporting short-term measures of HRV obtained in normally healthy individuals were collated and factors underlying discrepant values were identified. Forty-four studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria involving 21,438 participants. Values for short-term HRV measures from the literature were lower than Task Force norms. A degree of homogeneity for common measures of HRV in healthy adults was shown across studies. A number of studies demonstrate large interindividual variations (up to 260,000%), particularly for spectral measures. A number of methodological discrepancies underlined disparate values. These include a systematic failure within the literature (a) to recognize the importance of RR data recognition/editing procedures and (b) to question disparate HRV values observed in normally healthy individuals. A need for large-scale population studies and a review of the Task Force recommendations for short-term HRV that covers the full-age spectrum were identified. Data presented should be used to quantify reference ranges for short-term measures of HRV in healthy adult populations but should be undertaken with reference to methodological factors underlying disparate values.

  {"id":"Nunes2006","abstract":"BACKGROUND Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare complication of sarcoidosis, although it is not uncommon in advanced disease. METHODS A retrospective series of 22 sarcoidosis patients (16 men) of mean (SD) age 46 (13) years with PH was divided into two groups depending on the absence (stage 0: n = 2, stage II: n = 4, stage III: n = 1) or presence (n = 15) of radiographic pulmonary fibrosis at the time of PH diagnosis. RESULTS In both groups PH was moderate to severe and there was no response to acute vasodilator challenge. In non-fibrotic cases no other cause of PH was found, suggesting a specific sarcoidosis vasculopathy, although no histological specimens were available. In cases with fibrosis there was no correlation between haemodynamics and lung volumes or arterial oxygen tensions, suggesting other mechanisms for PH in addition to pulmonary destruction and hypoxaemia. These included extrinsic arterial compression by lymphadenopathies in three cases and histologically proven pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in the five patients who underwent lung transplantation. Ten patients received high doses of oral prednisone for PH (stage 0: n = 1, stage II: n = 4 and stage IV: n = 5); three patients without pulmonary fibrosis experienced a sustained haemodynamic response. Survival of the overall population was poor (59% at 5 years). Mortality was associated with NYHA functional class IV but not with haemodynamic parameters or with lung function. CONCLUSION Two very different phenotypes of sarcoidosis combined with PH are observed depending on the presence or absence of pulmonary fibrosis. PH is a severe complication of sarcoidosis.","author":[{"family":"Nunes","given":"H."},{"family":"Humbert","given":"M."},{"family":"Capron","given":"F."},{"family":"Brauner","given":"M."},{"family":"Sitbon","given":"O."},{"family":"Battesti","given":"J.

  {"id":"OFee2021","abstract":"Importance: Although nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an increased risk of mortality, evidence validating nonfatal MI as a surrogate end point for all-cause or cardiovascular (CV) mortality is lacking. Objective: To examine whether nonfatal MI may be a surrogate for all-cause or CV mortality in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease. Data Sources: In this meta-analysis, PubMed was searched from inception until December 31, 2020, for randomized clinical trials of interventions to treat or prevent coronary artery disease reporting mortality and nonfatal MI published in 3 leading journals. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials including at least 1000 patients with 24 months of follow-up. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Trial-level correlations between nonfatal MI and all-cause or CV mortality were assessed for surrogacy using the coefficient of determination (R2). The criterion for surrogacy was set at 0.8. Subgroup analyses based on study subject (primary prevention, secondary prevention, mixed primary and secondary prevention, and revascularization), era of trial (before 2000, 2000-2009, and 2010 and after), and follow-up duration (2.0-3.9, 4.0-5.9, and ≥6.0 years) were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause or CV mortality and nonfatal MI. Results: A total of 144 articles randomizing 1211897 patients met the criteria for inclusion. Nonfatal MI did not meet the threshold for surrogacy for all-cause (R2= 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08) or CV (R2= 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02-0.27) mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in primary (R2= 0.01; 95% CI, 0.001-0.26), secondary (R2= 0.03; 95% CI, 0.00-0.20), mixed primary and secondary prevention (R2= 0.001; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08), or revascularization trials (R2= 0.21; 95% CI, 0.002-0.50). For trials enrolling patients before 2000 (R2= 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.36), between 2000 and 2009 (R2= 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.17), and from 2010 and after (R2= 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00-0.09), nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality. Nonfatal MI was not a surrogate for all-cause mortality in randomized clinical trials with 2.0 to 3.9 (R2= 0.004; 95% CI, 0.00-0.08), 4.0 to 5.9 (R2= 0.06; 95% CI, 0.001-0.16), or 6.0 or more years of follow-up (R2= 0.30; 95% CI, 0.01-0.55).

Methods and Results-We examined the relationship between psychological status and incident HF among 6782 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Anger, anxiety, chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and hostility were measured using validated scales, and physician reviewers adjudicated incident HF events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for relevant demographic, behavioral, and physiological covariates. Interactions by age, race, sex, and self-reported health were examined in exploratory analyses. During a mean follow-up of 9.3 years, 242 participants developed incident HF. There was no association between psychosocial factors and HF hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quartile: anger=1.14 (0.81-1.60), anxiety=0.74 (0.51-1.07), chronic stress = 1.25 (0.90-1.72), depressive symptoms= 1.19 (0.76-1.85), and hostility = 0.95 (0.62-1.42). In exploratory analysis, among the participants reporting fair/poor health at baseline, those reporting high versus low levels of anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms had 2-fold higher risk of incident HF, but there was no association for those with good/very good/excellent self-reported health. Conclusions-Overall, these psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with incident HF. However, for participants reporting poor health at baseline, there was evidence that anxiety, chronic stress, and depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of HF. Future research with greater statistical power is necessary to replicate these findings and seek explanations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogilvie","given":"Rachel P."},{"family":"Everson-Rose","given":"Susan A."},{"family":"Longstreth","given":"W.

  {"id":"Ohira2008","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of psychosocial factors with heart rate (HR) and its variability across multiple ethnic groups and by gender. Increased HR and reduced HR variability are markers of increased cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2002, 6814 men and women (2624 Whites, 1895 African-Americans, 1492 Hispanics, and 803 Chinese) aged 45 to 84 years took part in the first examination of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Associations of psychosocial variables with mean values of HR and its short-term variability were tested, using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: In age, gender, race/ethnicity, and risk factor-adjusted analyses, a depressive symptom score was positively associated with HR and inversely associated with HR variability (standard deviation of normal-to-normal (N-N) interbeat intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in N-N intervals (RMSSD)). The adjusted mean differences per 1-SD (8 points) increment of depression score for HR, RMSSD, and SDNN were 0.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-0.7), -0.8 (95% CI, -1.5 to -0.2), and -0.7 (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2). The social support score was inversely associated with HR, but nonsignificantly associated with RMSSD and SDNN. There was no association of trait anger or trait anxiety with HR, RMSSD, or SDNN. Associations were generally consistent in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support the hypothesis that depression may be associated with increased HR and reduced HR variability, which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether newer HRV analysis algorithms, as used by the HeartTrends device, are superior to exercise stress testing (EST) for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We present pilot data of the first 100 subjects enrolled in a clinical trial designed to evaluate the yield of short-term (1 hour) HRV testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The study population comprised subjects without known CAD referred to a tertiary medical center for EST with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). All patients underwent a 1 hour electrocardiographic acquisition for HRV analysis with a HeartTrends device prior to ESTwith MPI. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were calculated for EST and HRV analysis, using MPI as the gold standard for the non-invasive detection of myocardial ischemia. RESULTS: In this cohort 15% had a pathologic MPI result. HRV analysis showed superior sensitivity (85%), PPV (50%) and NPV (97%) as compared to standard EST (53%, 42%, 90%, respectively), while the specificity of the two tests was similar (86% and 85%, respectively). The close agreement between HRV and MPI was even more pronounced among patients > 65 years of age.

  {"id":"Omar2017","abstract":"Background. There has been a decline in emphasis of the value of physical examination in heart failure (HF) with increased reliance on cardiac imaging. We aim to study the clinical and prognostic significance of positive hepatojugular reflux (HJR) on discharge in patients hospitalized with HF. Methods. Using the ESCAPE trial data, patients were compared according to the presence or absence of a positive HJR on discharge. The primary study endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite endpoint of death, rehospitalization, and cardiac transplant during the first 6 months after discharge. Results. Among 392 patients (age: 56 years, 74% men), the HJR correlated well with clinical and objective hemodynamic markers of volume overload including right atrial pressure (RAP, P = 0.002), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP, P = 0.006), and inferior vena cava size during inspiration (P = 0.005) and expiration (P = 0.003). The RAP had the highest AUC for predicting a positive HJR on admission (AUC: 0.655, P = 0.004) and discharge (AUC: 0.672, P = 0.001). Cox's proportional hazards analysis revealed that a positive HJR on discharge is an independent predictor of 6-month mortality (estimated hazard ratio: 1.689; 95% CI: 1.032-2.764; P = 0.037) after adjusting for age, baseline creatinine, baseline hematocrit, baseline NYHA class, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the presence of tricuspid regurgitation.

We examined if acute mental stress results in abnormal left atrial electrophysiology as detected by more negative deflection of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1), a well-known marker of AF risk.\n\nMethods and Results\nWe examined this hypothesis in 422 patients (mean age=56±10 years; 61% men; 44% white) with stable coronary heart disease who underwent mental (speech task) stress testing. PTFV1 was defined as the duration (ms) times the value of the depth (µV) of the downward deflection (terminal portion) of the P-wave in lead V1 measured on digital electrocardiograms (ECG).

  {"id":"Opthof1991","abstract":"In 18 dogs on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the average interval between local activations during artificially induced ventricular fibrillation (VF interval) was measured from extracellular electrograms, simultaneously recorded from up to 32 ventricular sites. VF intervals were used as an index of local refractoriness, based on the assumption that during ventricular fibrillation, cells are reexcited as soon as they have recovered their excitability. In support of this, microelectrode recordings in two hearts during ventricular fibrillation did not show a diastolic interval between successive action potentials. Refractory periods determined at a basic cycle length of 300 msec with the extrastimulus method correlated well with VF intervals measured at the same sites. Thus, this technique allows assessment of spatial dispersion of refractoriness during brief interventions such as sympathetic stimulation. The responses to left, right, and combined stellate ganglion stimulation varied substantially among individual hearts. This was observed both in dogs with an intact (n = 12) and decentralized (n = 6) autonomic nervous system. Individual ventricular sites could show effects of both left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (42% of tested sites) or show effects of left-sided stimulation only (31%) or right-sided stimulation only (14%). In 13% of sites, no effects of stellate stimulation were observed. Apart from these regional effects, the responses could be qualitatively different; that is, within the same heart, the VF interval prolonged at one site but shortened at another in response to the same intervention, although shortening was the general effect and prolongation the exception. Whenever sites responded to stellate ganglion stimulation with a shortening of VF interval, this shortening was approximately 10% for left, right, or combined stimulation, whether the autonomic nervous system was intact or decentralized. In six of 12 hearts in the intact group, there was a distinct regional effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation; in the other six hearts, the effects were distributed homogeneously over the ventricles. In three hearts, the effect of left stellate ganglion stimulation was strongest in the posterior wall, and in the other three hearts, in the anterior wall. The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation were restricted to the anterior or lateral part of the left ventricle. Dispersion of VF intervals increased after left and combined stellate ganglion stimulation in the intact group and after right stellate ganglion stimulation in the decentralized group, but not significantly in every heart. This points to a marked individual variation with regard to the effects of sympathetic stimulation on electrophysiological properties of the heart.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Opthof","given":"T"},{"family":"Misier","given":"A R"},{"family":"Coronel","given":"R"},{"family":"Vermeulen","given":"J T"},{"family":"Verberne","given":"H J"},{"family":"Frank","given":"R G"},{"family":"Moulijn","given":"A C"},{"family":"Capelle","given":"F J","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Janse","given":"M J"}],"citation-key":"Opthof1991","container-title":"Circulation research","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",5]]},"page":"1204-15","PMID":"2018987","title":"Dispersion of refractoriness in canine ventricular myocardium.

  {"id":"Orso2018","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Fluid responsiveness is the ability to increase the cardiac output in response to a fluid challenge. Only about 50% of patients receiving fluid resuscitation for acute circulatory failure increase their stroke volume, but the other 50% may worsen their outcome. Therefore, predicting fluid responsiveness is needed. In this purpose, in recent years, the assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) through ultrasound (US) has become very popular. The aim of our work was to systematically review all the previously published studies assessing the accuracy of the diameter of IVC or its respiratory variations measured through US in predicting fluid responsiveness. DATA SOURCES We searched in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science databases for all relevant articles from inception to September 2017. STUDY SELECTION Included articles specifically addressed the accuracy of IVC diameter or its respiratory variations assessed by US in predicting the fluid responsiveness in critically ill ventilated or not, adult or pediatric patients. DATA EXTRACTION We included 26 studies that investigated the role of the caval index (IVC collapsibility or distensibility) and 5 studies on IVC diameter. DATA SYNTHESIS We conducted a meta-analysis for caval index with 20 studies: The pooled area under the curve, logarithmic diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.83), 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29-2.89), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80), and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85), respectively.

  {"id":"Ossola2018","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Depression is an established risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with an impact on cardiac prognosis; nonetheless, the literature disagrees on the role played by anxiety. No study has evaluated this relationship in a cardiac population with no history of depression and after their first diagnosis of ACS. The aim of this study is to explore these associations without the confounding role of long-lasting heart disease or psychiatric illnesses. METHOD Two hundred sixty-six patients with no history of depression completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorder at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months follow-up after their first diagnosis of ACS. During the follow-up period, we collected information regarding the major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS Developing a first-ever depressive episode, in a proportional hazard model, was associated with almost 3 times the risk of a recurrent cardiac event (odds ratio = 2.590, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.321, 5.078], p = .006). Furthermore, a moderation analysis revealed that increasing levels of baseline anxiety had opposing effects on cardiac outcomes, being protective only in those who did not develop incident depression (B = -0.0824, 95% CI [-0.164, -0.005], p = .048). No dose-response effect between depressive or anxious symptoms and cardiac outcomes emerged. CONCLUSION Our results confirm the detrimental effect of depression on cardiac prognosis in a selected population and suggest that anxiety after the first diagnosis of ACS might have different roles depending on the illness' course.

  {"id":"OSullivan2022","abstract":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading contributor to years lost due to disability or premature death among adults. Current efforts focus on risk prediction and risk factor mitigation‚ which have been recognized for the past half-century. However, despite advances, risk prediction remains imprecise with persistently high rates of incident cardiovascular disease. Genetic characterization has been proposed as an approach to enable earlier and potentially tailored prevention. Rare mendelian pathogenic variants predisposing to cardiometabolic conditions have long been known to contribute to disease risk in some families. However, twin and familial aggregation studies imply that diverse cardiovascular conditions are heritable in the general population. Significant technological and methodological advances since the Human Genome Project are facilitating population-based comprehensive genetic profiling at decreasing costs. Genome-wide association studies from such endeavors continue to elucidate causal mechanisms for cardiovascular diseases. Systematic cataloging for cardiovascular risk alleles also enabled the development of polygenic risk scores. Genetic profiling is becoming widespread in large-scale research, including in health care–associated biobanks, randomized controlled trials, and direct-to-consumer profiling in tens of millions of people. Thus, individuals and their physicians are increasingly presented with polygenic risk scores for cardiovascular conditions in clinical encounters. In this scientific statement, we review the contemporary science, clinical considerations, and future challenges for polygenic risk scores for cardiovascular diseases.

  {"id":"Ozga2018a","abstract":"Background Many clinical trials focus on the comparison of the treatment effect between two or more groups concerning a rarely occurring event. In this situation, showing a relevant effect with an acceptable power requires the observation of a large number of patients over a long period of time. For feasibility issues, it is therefore often considered to include several event types of interest, non-fatal or fatal, and to combine them within a composite endpoint. Commonly, a composite endpoint is analyzed with standard survival analysis techniques by assessing the time to the first occurring event. This approach neglects that an individual may experience more than one event which leads to a loss of information. As an alternative, composite endpoints could be analyzed by models for recurrent events. There exists a number of such models, e.g. regression models based on count data or Cox-based models such as the approaches of Andersen and Gill, Prentice, Williams and Peterson or, Wei, Lin and Weissfeld. Although some of the methods were already compared within the literature there exists no systematic investigation for the special requirements regarding composite endpoints. Methods Within this work a simulation-based comparison of recurrent event models applied to composite endpoints is provided for different realistic clinical trial scenarios. Results We demonstrate that the Andersen-Gill model and the Prentice- Williams-Petersen models show similar results under various data scenarios whereas the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model delivers effect estimators which can considerably deviate under commonly met data scenarios. Conclusion Based on the conducted simulation study, this paper helps to understand the pros and cons of the investigated methods in the context of composite endpoints and provides therefore recommendations for an adequate statistical analysis strategy and a meaningful interpretation of results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ozga","given":"Ann Kathrin"},{"family":"Kieser","given":"Meinhard"},{"family":"Rauch","given":"Geraldine"}],"citation-key":"Ozga2018a","container-title":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","DOI":"10.1186/s12874-017-0462-x","ISSN":"14712288","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"title":"A systematic comparison of recurrent event models for application to composite endpoints","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"Packer2019","abstract":"Importance: Catheter ablation is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effects on long-term mortality and stroke risk are uncertain. Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2% female; 42.9% had paroxysmal AF and 57.1% had persistent AF), 89.3% completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8%) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5%) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0% (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2% (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2% vs 6.1% for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7% vs 58.1% for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9% vs 69.5% for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45-0.60]; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.","author":[{"family":"Packer","given":"Douglas L."},{"family":"Mark","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Robb","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Monahan","given":"Kristi H."},{"family":"Bahnson","given":"Tristram D."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Jeanne E."},{"family":"Noseworthy","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Yves D."},{"family":"Jeffries","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"L.

  {"id":"Packer2020","abstract":"Historically, atrial fibrillation has been observed in clinical settings of prolonged hemodynamic stress, eg, hypertension and valvular heart disease. However, recently, the most prominent precedents to atrial fibrillation are metabolic diseases that are associated with adipose tissue inflammation (ie, obesity and diabetes mellitus) and systemic inflammatory disorders (ie, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis). These patients typically have little evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation; instead, imaging reveals abnormalities of the structure or function of the atria, particularly the left atrium, indicative of an atrial myopathy. The left atrium is enlarged, fibrotic and noncompliant, potentially because the predisposing disorder leads to an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue, which transmits proinflammatory mediators to the underlying left atrium. The development of an atrial myopathy not only leads to atrial fibrillation, but also contributes to pulmonary venous hypertension and systemic thromboembolism. These mechanisms explain why disorders of systemic or adipose tissue inflammation are accompanied an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, abnormalities of left atrium geometry and an enhanced risk of stroke. The risk of stroke exceeds that predicted by conventional cardiovascular risk factors or thromboembolism risk scores used to guide the use of anticoagulation, but it is strongly linked to clinical evidence and biomarkers of systemic inflammation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Packer","given":"Milton"}],"citation-key":"Packer2020","container-title":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.119.015343","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,9]]},"page":"e015343","publisher":"Wiley","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Characterization, Pathogenesis, and Clinical Implications of Inflammation‐Related Atrial Myopathy as an Important Cause of Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015343","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Pagani1982","abstract":"The role of pressor sympathetic reflexes in circulatory control was investigated in conscious dogs. Animals were previously instrumented with a 6- to 8-cm rigid core cannula covered by an inflatable rubber cylinder in the thoracic aorta, a pressure catheter implanted in the aorta above the cannula, and a second catheter inserted into the aorta below the cannula through a femoral artery. Two piezoelectric crystals were positioned at opposing adventitial sites to measure aortic distension with ultrasound techniques. After recovery from surgery, the diameter of the aortic segment surrounding the cannula was increased by 9.6 +/- 0.4% from 16 +/- 1 mm by inflating the rubber cylinder, without obstructing blood flow. Mean aortic pressure rose 31 +/- 3% from 100 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate 20 +/- 3% from 91 +/- 3 beats/min (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was abolished by alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine 1 mg/kg, iv). The heart rate response was reduced either by beta-blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg, iv) or muscarinic blockade (atropine 0.2 mg/kg, iv) and abolished by their combination. During aortic stretch, the sensitivity of the baroreflex was reduced 57 +/- 7% from 18 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg (P less than 0.01). The pressor response was increased by 49 +/- 8% after bilateral carotid sinus nerve section and vagotomy. These excitatory reflex responses were obtained in absence of any pain reaction. Thus, in the conscious dog, aortic distension within physiological ranges induces a potent pressor sympathetic reflex with positive feedback characteristics. Such a pressor reflex not only occurs in the presence of functioning baroreflexes, but is also capable of reducing their sensitivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pagani","given":"M"},{"family":"Pizzinelli","given":"P"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"M"},{"family":"Malliani","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Pagani1982","container-title":"Circulation research","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",1]]},"page":"125-32","PMID":"6119167","title":"A positive feedback sympathetic pressor reflex during stretch of the thoracic aorta in conscious dogs.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6119167","volume":"50"},

Abstract Since its introduction in 1982, percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMV) has been used successfully as an alternative to open or closed surgical mitral commissurotomy in the treatment of patients with symptomatic rheumatic mitral stenosis. PMV is safe and effective and provides sustained clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients with mitral stenosis. The immediate and long-term results appear to be similar to those of surgical mitral commissurotomy. Proper patient selection is an essential step for being able to predict the immediate results of PMV. Candidates for PMV require precise assessment of the mitral valve morphology. The Wilkin's echocardiographic score (Echo-Sc) is currently the most widely used method for predicting PMV outcome. Leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, valvular calcification, and sub valvular disease are each scored from 1 to 4. An inverse relationship exists between the Echo-Sc and PMV success. Both immediate and intermediate follow-up studies have shown that patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have superior results, significantly greater survival, and event free survival compared to patients with Echo-Sc > 8. We identified other clinical and morphologic predictors of PMV success that include age, pre-PMV mitral valve area, history of previous surgical commissurotomy, and mitral regurgitation (MR), and post-PMV variables (e.g., post-PMV MR ≥ 3 + and pulmonary artery pressure), that may be used in conjunction with the Echo-Sc to optimally identify candidates for PMV. This concept demonstrates a multifactorial nature of the prediction of immediate and long-term results. Other echocardiographic scores have been developed for the screening of potential candidates for PMV. They include a unique score that take into account the length of the chordae. A novel quantitative score that included the ratio of the commissural areas over the maximal excursion of the leaflets from the annulus in diastole. The components of this score include mitral valve area ≤ 1 cm 2 , maximum leaflet displacement ≤ 12 mm, commissural area ratio ≥ 1.25, and sub valvular involvement. Finally, a score that is able to identify patients who are more Page 2 of 24 Palacios Mini-invasive Surg 2020;4:73 I http://dx.doi.org/10.20517/2574-1225.2020.72 likely to develop significant mitral regurgitation post-PMV. This score takes into account the distribution (even or uneven) of leaflet thickening and calcification, the degree and symmetry of commissural disease, and the severity of subvalvular disease. The transvenous transseptal approach is the most widely used PMV technique. The two major techniques of PMV are the double-balloon technique and the Inoue technique which are equally effective techniques of PMV. Encouraging results of PMV have been reported in special mitral stenosis population cohorts including pregnant women, patients with previous surgical commissurotomy, patients with atrial fibrillation, patients with pulmonary hypertension, elderly patients, patients with calcific mitral stenosis, and patients with associated aortic regurgitation. To summarize, PMV is the preferred form of therapy for relief of mitral stenosis for a selected group of patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis and suitable valve anatomy for valvuloplasty. Patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8 have the best results, particularly if they are young, are in normal sinus rhythm, have no pulmonary hypertension, and have no evidence of calcification of the mitral valve under fluoroscopy. The immediate and long-term results of PMV in this group of patients are similar to those reported after surgical mitral commissurotomy. Patients with Echo-Sc > 8 have only a 50% chance to obtain a successful hemodynamic result with PMV, and the long-term follow-up results are worse than those from patients with Echo-Sc ≤ 8. In patients with Echo-Sc ≥ 12, it is unlikely that PMV could produce good immediate or long-term results and they preferably should undergo mitral valve replacement. However, PMV could be considered in these patients if they are high-risk or unqualified surgical candidates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Palacios","given":"Igor F."}],"citation-key":"Palacios2020","container-title":"Mini-invasive Surgery","DOI":"10.20517/2574-1225.2020.72","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,24]]},"publisher":"OAE Publishing Inc.","title":"Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty - state of the art","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://misjournal.net/article/view/3725","volume":"2020"},
  {"id":"Pangaro2013","abstract":"In any evaluation system of medical trainees there is an underlying set of assumptions about what is to be evaluated (i.e., which goals reflect the values of the system or institution), what kind of observations or assessments are useful to allow judgments 1 ; and how these are to be analyzed and compared to a standard of what is to be achieved by the learner. These assumptions can be conventionalized into a framework for evaluation. Frameworks encompass, or \"frame,\" a group of ideas or categories to reflect the educational goals against which a trainee's level of competence or progress is gauged. Different frameworks provide different ways of looking at the practice of medicine and have different purposes. In the first place, frameworks should enable educators to determine to what extent trainees are ready for advancement, that is, whether the desired competence has been attained. They should provide both a valid mental model of competence and also terms to describe successful performance, either at the end of training or as milestones during the curriculum. Consequently, such frameworks drive learning by providing learners with a guide for what is expected. Frameworks should also enhance consistency and reliability of ratings across staff and settings. Finally, they determine the content of, and resources needed for, rater training to achieve consistency of use. This is especially important in clinical rotations, in which reliable assessments have been most difficult to achieve. Because the limitations of workplace-based assessment have persisted despite the use of traditional frameworks (such as those based on knowledge, skills, and attitudes), this Guide will explore the assumptions and characteristics of traditional and newer frameworks. In this AMEE Guide, we make a distinction between analytic, synthetic, and developmental frameworks. Analytic frameworks deconstruct competence into individual pieces, to evaluate each separately. Synthetic frameworks attempt to view competence holistically, focusing evaluation on the performance in real-world activities. Developmental frameworks focus on stages of, or milestones, in the progression toward competence. Most frameworks have one predominant perspective; some have a hybrid nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pangaro","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Ten Cate","given":"Olle"}],"citation-key":"Pangaro2013","container-title":"Medical Teacher","DOI":"10.3109/0142159X.2013.788789","ISBN":"1466-187X","ISSN":"0142159X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,16]]},"page":"e1197-e1210","PMID":"23676179","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","title":"Frameworks for learner assessment in medicine: AMEE Guide No. 78","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/0142159X.2013.788789","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"Paniccia2017","abstract":"Background Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning, has emerged as a physiological indicator for emotional regulation and psychological well-being. HRV is understudied in the context of depression and anxiety in young people (10–24 years old). Main objectives: (1) describe the nature and breadth of reviewed studies; and (2) synthesize main findings in the context of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression and/or anxiety. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was utilized for this scoping review. CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full papers for inclusion. A total of 20 citations were included in the final review (19 citations peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 journal abstract). Numerical and thematic analysis was used to summarize study findings. Results In clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was lower compared to controls. In non-clinical populations of either depression or anxiety, HRV was found to be lower in those who reported more depression or anxiety symptoms. Limitations The quality of the reviewed articles was not assessed which limits the ability to generate conclusions regarding study findings. Conclusion Changes in HRV were found across the spectrum of clinical and non-clinical populations of young people with depression or anxiety. Neurophysiological research on depression and anxiety in young people can act as a first step to understanding how physiological flexibility (i.e. HRV) is related to psychological flexibility (i.e. adaptive or maladaptive responses to life events).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Paniccia","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Paniccia","given":"David"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Taha","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"Paniccia2017","container-title":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2017.08.008","ISBN":"1872-7484 (Electronic) 1566-0702 (Linking)","ISSN":"18727484","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"1-14","PMID":"28870754","title":"Clinical and non-clinical depression and anxiety in young people: A scoping review on heart rate variability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28870754","volume":"208"},

Obese individuals have a relative NP deficiency and disturbed BP rhythmicity. Objectives: This clinical trial evaluated the diurnal rhythmicity of NPs (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide [MR-proANP], N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) and the relationship of NP rhythm with 24-h BP rhythm in healthy lean and obese individuals. Methods: On the background of a standardized diet, healthy, normotensive, lean (body mass index 18.5 to 25 kg/m2) and obese (body mass index 30 to 45 kg/m2) individuals, age 18 to 40 years, underwent 24-h inpatient protocol involving ambulatory BP monitoring starting 24 h prior to the visit, controlled light intensity, and repeated blood draws for assessment of analytes. Cosinor analysis of normalized NP levels (normalized to 24-h mean value) was conducted to assess the diurnal NP rhythm and its relationship with systolic BP. Results: Among 52 participants screened, 40 participants (18 lean, 22 obese; 50% women; 65% Black) completed the study. The median range spread (percentage difference between the minimum and maximum values) over 24 h for MR-proANP, BNP, and NT-proBNP levels was 72.0% (interquartile range [IQR]: 50.9% to 119.6%), 75.5% (IQR: 50.7% to 106.8%), and 135.0% (IQR: 66.3% to 270.4%), respectively. A cosine wave-shaped 24-h oscillation of normalized NP levels (BNP, MR-proANP, and NT-proBNP) was noted both in lean and obese individuals (prhythmicity <0.05 for all). A larger phase difference between MR-proANP BP rhythm (−4.9 h vs. −0.7 h) and BNP BP rhythm (−3.3 h vs. −0.9 h) was seen in obese compared with lean individuals. Conclusions: This human physiological trial elucidates evidence of diurnal NP rhythmicity and the presence of an NP-BP rhythm axis. There exists a misalignment of the NP-BP diurnal rhythm in the obese, which may contribute to the disturbed diurnal BP pattern observed among obese individuals.

  {"id":"Pardini1989","abstract":"The origins and organization of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic nerves in the rat were identified in the present investigation. The retrograde tracer, Diamidino Yellow, was injected into the right or left ventricles to label somata in the sympathetic chain. Analysis of all sympathetic ganglia from superior cervical ganglion through the 10th thoracic ganglion indicated that the postganglionic innervation of the rat cardiac ventricles originates bilaterally. The majority of these somata were located in the middle and inferior cervical ganglia (middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex) (approximately 92% of all labelled cells), with lesser contributions from the superior cervical and 4th through 6th thoracic ganglia. To confirm and further quantitate these findings, the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex was removed (MC-S ganglionectomy) bilaterally or ipsilaterally from the left or right sides, and regional cardiac norepinephrine concentration (left and right atrial appendages and left and right ventricles) was analysed 7 or 28 days later. At both times after bilateral MC-S ganglionectomy, regional cardiac norepinephrine was reduced by 89% to 100%, indicating the removal of almost all cardiac noradrenergic cells of origin and possibly fibers of passage. The results of unilateral MC-S ganglionectomy experiments indicated that the atrial appendages and the left ventricle receive bilateral innervation from the middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex. However, the left middle cervical-stellate ganglion complex appears to contribute a majority of the norepinephrine to the right ventricle. Furthermore, between 7 and 28 days after contralateral MC-S ganglionectomy, atrial appendages, but not ventricles, display significant recovery of norepinephrine content. The present data demonstrate: (1) a bilateral locus of origin of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons, limited longitudinally to cervical through mid-thoracic ganglia, and (2) the ability of the cardiac postganglionic innervation to regenerate after partial denervation. These results demonstrate anatomical evidence for significant bilateral integration of cardiac sympathetic activity at the level of the sympathetic ganglion in the rat. © 1989.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pardini","given":"Benet J."},{"family":"Lund","given":"Donald D."},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Phillip G."}],"citation-key":"Pardini1989","container-title":"Journal of the Autonomic Nervous System","DOI":"10.1016/0165-1838(89)90146-X","ISSN":"01651838","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",12,1]]},"page":"193-201","PMID":"2628461","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Organization of the sympathetic postganglionic innervation of the rat heart","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.library.emory.edu/science/article/pii/016518388990146X","volume":"28"},

This review will briefly summarize the neural mechanisms of atrial fibrillation.\\n\\nRECENT FINDINGS: Complex interactions exist between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system on the atrial electrophysiologic properties. Direct autonomic recordings in canine models demonstrated simultaneous sympathovagal discharges are the most common triggers of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Also, intrinsic cardiac autonomic nerve can serve as a sole triggering factor for the initiation of atrial fibrillation. Modulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) by electrical stimulation has been tried as a treatment strategy clinically and experimentally. Recent studies showed that autonomic nervous system modulation can suppress the stellate ganglion nerve activity and reduce the incidence of paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory dogs.\\n\\nSUMMARY: The autonomic nerve system influences the initiation and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation. Scientific advances toward a better understanding of the complex interrelationships of the various components of the ANS will hopefully lead to improvement of treatments for this common arrhythmia.","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Hyung-wook"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Mark J"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Shien-fong"},{"family":"Fishbein","given":"Michael C"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lan S."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peng-sheng"}],"citation-key":"Park2013","container-title":"Current Opinion in Cardiology","DOI":"10.1097/HCO.0b013e32834dc4e8","ISBN":"3179620145","ISSN":"0268-4705","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1]]},"page":"24-28","title":"Neural mechanisms of atrial fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.lww.com/00001573-201201000-00006","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"Park2019","abstract":"Importance: Short sleep has been associated with obesity, but to date the association between exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) while sleeping and obesity is unknown. Objective: To determine whether ALAN exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. Exposures: Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [WC] ≥88 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR] ≥0.85, or waist-to-height ratio [WHtR]≥0.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported BMI at enrollment was compared with self-reported BMI at follow-up (mean [SD] follow-up, 5.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs for prevalent and incident obesity. Results: Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using BMI (PR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), WC (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.16), WHR (PR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and WHtR (PR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P <.001 for trend for each measure. Having any ALAN exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no ALAN, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27; P <.001 for trend), a BMI increase of 10% or more (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P =.04 for trend), incident overweight (RR, 1.22; 95% CI,1.06-1.40; P =.03 for trend), and incident obesity (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57; P <.001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that exposure to ALAN while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to ALAN while sleeping can promote obesity prevention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Yong Moon Mark"},{"family":"White","given":"Alexandra J."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Chandra L."},{"family":"Weinberg","given":"Clarice R."},{"family":"Sandler","given":"Dale P."}],"citation-key":"Park2019","container-title":"JAMA Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.0571","ISSN":"21686106","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"page":"1061-1071","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Association of Exposure to Artificial Light at Night while Sleeping with Risk of Obesity in Women","type":"article-journal","volume":"179"},
  {"id":"Parsons2006","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prevention of obesity has focused on childhood as a target period. Our aim was to assess whether frequency of adolescent physical activity affected subsequent body mass index (BMI) gain through to mid-adulthood. METHODS: The British birth cohort of all births in 1 week in March 1958, includes information on physical activity frequency and BMI for several ages, 11-45 years. We examined relationships between activity in adolescence and trajectories of BMI between 16 years (or 23 years) and 45 years using multi-level models. Effects of change in activity on BMI and on change in BMI were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: Physical activity at 11 years had no effect on the BMI trajectories, in males or females. More active females at 16 years gained BMI more slowly than others, by 0.007 kg/m2/year per activity category over the period 16-45 years, whereas the most active males gained BMI faster than others, by 0.005 kg/m2/year per activity category. This effect in males was not evident on the BMI trajectory from 23 to 45 years. Consistent with these analyses, change in activity was associated with change in BMI in females, e.g. females active at 16 and 42 years gained less BMI than inactive females (2.1 vs 2.5 kg/m2/10 years). Results for males were inconsistent over the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may lessen the gains in BMI from adolescence onwards, but relationships vary with age, and in later adolescence show opposite effects for males and females. Decreasing activity between adolescence and mid-adulthood in males, and inactivity in both life stages in females may increase BMI gain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Parsons","given":"Rodney L."},{"family":"Locknar","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Young","given":"Beth A."},{"family":"Hoard","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Hoover","given":"Donald B."}],"citation-key":"Parsons2006","container-title":"Cell and Tissue Research","DOI":"10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3","ISSN":"0302-766X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,12]]},"page":"197-209","title":"Presence and co-localization of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide with neuronal nitric oxide synthase in cells and nerve fibers within guinea pig intrinsic cardiac ganglia and cardiac tissue","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00441-005-0074-3","volume":"323"},

  {"id":"Parvez2012a","abstract":"Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF. These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent. Methods: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry. Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with <75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden. We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG. Results: In the discovery cohort, 399 (83%) patients were successfully rhythm controlled. Multiple clinical variables (including age, hypertension, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (wild type) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013. In the validation cohort, 143 (72%) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04. This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39% AF recurrence) and validation (38% AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.7 to 6, p < 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p < 0.001, respectively.

The superior cervical cardiac ramus originated from the superior cervical ganglion (present in all specimens) in 53% of cases. The middle cervical ganglion (incidence 81%) gave rise to the middle cervical cardiac ramus in 88% of cases. The cervico-thoracic ganglion (incidence 85%) gave the cervico-thoracic cardiac ramus in 84%. In the thoracic region, four cardiac rami arose from the T2-T6 segment of the thoracic sympathetic trunk. All cervical and thoracic cardiac rami were traced consistently to the deep cardiac plexus. Khogali et al.'s (1999) success of limited T2-T4 sympathectomy in relieving pain at rest of patients with intractable angina pectoris appears to indicate that a significant afferent pain pathway from the heart is selectively interrupted. The variability in pattern of the cervical ganglia, cardiac rami and cervical contributions to the cardiac plexus does not appear to affect the outcome of limited sympathectomy. The complexity of cardiac pain pathways is not fully understood. The study is continuing and attempts to contribute to defining these cardiac neuronal pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Pather","given":"N."},{"family":"Partab","given":"P."},{"family":"Singh","given":"B."},{"family":"Satyapal","given":"K.

  {"id":"Patil2015b","abstract":"The modern treatment of cardiac arrest is an increasingly complex medical procedure with a rapidly changing array of therapeutic approaches designed to restore life to victims of sudden death. The 2 primary goals of providing artificial circulation and defibrillation to halt ventricular fibrillation remain of paramount importance for saving lives. They have undergone significant improvements in technology and dissemination into the community subsequent to their establishment 60 years ago. The evolution of artificial circulation includes efforts to optimize manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, external mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices designed to augment circulation, and may soon advance further into the rapid deployment of specially designed internal emergency cardiopulmonary bypass devices. The development of defibrillation technologies has progressed from bulky internal defibrillators paddles applied directly to the heart, to manually controlled external defibrillators, to automatic external defibrillators that can now be obtained over-the-counter for widespread use in the community or home. But the modern treatment of cardiac arrest now involves more than merely providing circulation and defibrillation. As suggested by a 3-phase model of treatment, newer approaches targeting patients who have had a more prolonged cardiac arrest include treatment of the metabolic phase of cardiac arrest with therapeutic hypothermia, agents to treat or prevent reperfusion injury, new strategies specifically focused on pulseless electric activity, which is the presenting rhythm in at least one third of cardiac arrests, and aggressive post resuscitation care. There are discoveries at the cellular and molecular level about ischemia and reperfusion pathobiology that may be translated into future new therapies. On the near horizon is the combination of advanced cardiopulmonary bypass plus a cocktail of multiple agents targeted at restoration of normal metabolism and prevention of reperfusion injury, as this holds the promise of restoring life to many patients for whom our current therapies fail.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Patil","given":"Kaustubha D."},{"family":"Halperin","given":"Henry R."},{"family":"Becker","given":"Lance B."}],"citation-key":"Patil2015b","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304495","ISBN":"1524-4571","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"2041-2049","PMID":"26044255","title":"Cardiac Arrest: Resuscitation and Reperfusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://circres.ahajournals.org","volume":"116"},

  {"id":"Paur2012","abstract":"Background-Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute heart failure syndrome characterized by myocardial hypocontractility from the mid left ventricle to the apex. It is precipitated by extreme stress and can be triggered by intravenous catecholamine administration, particularly epinephrine. Despite its grave presentation, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rapidly reversible, with generally good prognosis. We hypothesized that this represents switching of epinephrine signaling through the pleiotropic β 2-adrenergic receptor (β 2AR) from canonical stimulatory G-protein-activated cardiostimulant to inhibitory G-protein-activated cardiodepressant pathways. Methods and Results-We describe an in vivo rat model in which a high intravenous epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, bolus produces the characteristic reversible apical depression of myocardial contraction coupled with basal hypercontractility. The effect is prevented via Gi inactivation by pertussis toxin pretreatment. β 2AR number and functional responses were greater in isolated apical cardiomyocytes than in basal cardiomyocytes, which confirmed the higher apical sensitivity and response to circulating epinephrine. In vitro studies demonstrated high-dose epinephrine can induce direct cardiomyocyte cardiodepression and cardioprotection in a β 2AR- Gi-dependent manner. Preventing epinephrine-Gi effects increased mortality in the Takotsubo model, whereas β-blockers that activate β 2AR- Gi exacerbated the epinephrine-dependent negative inotropic effects without further deaths. In contrast, levosimendan rescued the acute cardiac dysfunction without increased mortality. Conclusions-We suggest that biased agonism of epinephrine for β 2AR-Gs at low concentrations and for Gi at high concentrations underpins the acute apical cardiodepression observed in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with an apical-basal gradient in β 2ARs explaining the differential regional responses. We suggest this epinephrine-specific β 2AR-Gi signaling may have evolved as a cardioprotective strategy to limit catecholamine-induced myocardial toxicity during acute stress. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Paur","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Sikkel","given":"Markus B."},{"family":"Tranter","given":"Matthew H."},{"family":"Mansfield","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"O'Gara","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Stuckey","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Nikolaev","given":"Viacheslav O."},{"family":"Diakonov","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Pannell","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Haibin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Nicholas S."},{"family":"Petrou","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Zhaolun"},{"family":"Gorelik","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Lyon","given":"Alexander R."},{"family":"Harding","given":"Sian E."}],"citation-key":"Paur2012","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.111591","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,7]]},"page":"697-706","PMID":"22732314","publisher":"Europe PMC Funders","title":"High levels of circulating epinephrine trigger apical cardiodepression in a β 2-adrenergic receptor/Gi-dependent manner: A new model of takotsubo cardiomyopathy","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC4890655/?report=abstract","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"Pauza2000","abstract":"Concomitant with the development of surgical treatment of cardiac arrythmias and management of myocardial ischemia, there is renewed interest in morphology of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system. In this study, we analyze the topography and structure of the human epicardiac neural plexus (ENP) as a system of seven ganglionated subplexuses. The morphology of the ENP was revealed by a histochemical method for acetylcholinesterase in whole hearts of 21 humans and examined by stereoscopic, contact, and bright-field microscopy. According to criteria established to distinguish ganglionated subplexuses, they are epicardiac extensions of mediastinal nerves entering the heart through discrete sites of the heart hilum and proceeding separately into regions of innervation by seven pathways, on the courses of which epicardiac ganglia, as wide ganglionated fields, are plentifully located. It was established that topography of epicardiac subplexuses was consistent from heart to heart. In general, the human right atrium was innervated by two subplexuses, the left atrium by three, the right ventricle by one, and the left ventricle by three subplexuses. The highest density of epicardiac ganglia was identified near the heart hilum, especially on the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the left atrium, where up to 50% of all cardiac ganglia were located. The number of epicardiac ganglia identified for the human hearts in this study ranged from 706 up to 1,560 and was not correlated with age in most heart regions. The human heart contained on average 836 +/- 76 epicardiac ganglia. The structural organization of ganglia and nerves within subplexuses was observed to vary considerably from heart to heart and in relation to age. The number of neurons identified for any epicardiac ganglion was significantly fewer in aged human compared with infants. By estimating the number of neurons within epicardiac ganglia and relating this to the number of ganglia in the human epicardium, it was calculated that approximately 43,000 intrinsic neurons might be present in the ENP in adult hearts and 94,000 neurons in young hearts (fetuses, neonates, and children). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the total ENP in humans using staining for acetylcholinesterase, and provides a morphological framework for an understanding of how intrinsic ganglia and nerves are structurally organized within the human heart.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pauza","given":"Dainius H."},{"family":"Skripka","given":"Valdas"},{"family":"Pauziene","given":"Neringa"},{"family":"Stropus","given":"Rimvydas"}],"citation-key":"Pauza2000","container-title":"Anatomical Record","DOI":"10.1002/1097-0185(20000801)259:4<353::AID-AR10>3.0.CO;2-R","ISSN":"0003276X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,1]]},"page":"353-382","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Morphology, distribution, and variability of the epicardiac neural ganglionated subplexuses in the human heart","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/1097-0185%2820000801%29259%3A4%3C353%3A%3AAID-AR10%3E3.0.CO%3B2-R","volume":"259"},
  {"id":"Pauza2013","abstract":"The mouse heart is a popular model to study the function and autonomic control of the specialized cardiac conduction system (CCS). However, the precise identity and anatomical distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that modulate the function of the mouse CCS have not been adequately studied. We aimed at determining the organization and distribution of the intrinsic cardiac nerves that supply the CCS of the mouse. In whole mouse heart preparations, intrinsic neural structures were revealed by histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adrenergic, cholinergic and peptidergic neural components were identified, respectively, by immunohistochemical labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5). Myocytes of the CCS were identified by immunolabeling of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4 (HCN4). In addition, the presence of CCS myocytes in atypical locations was verified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry performed on routine paraffin sections. The results demonstrate that four microscopic epicardial nerves orientated toward the sinuatrial nodal (SAN) region derive from both the dorsal right atrial and right ventral nerve subplexuses. The atrioventricular nodal (AVN) region is typically supplied by a single intrinsic nerve derived from the left dorsal nerve subplexus at the posterior interatrial groove. SAN myocytes positive for HCN4 were widely distributed both on the medial, anterior, lateral and even posterior sides of the root of the right cranial (superior caval) vein. The distribution of HCN4-positive myocytes in the AVN region was also wider than previously considered. HCN4-positive cells and thin slivers of the AVN extended to the roots of the ascending aorta, posteriorly to the orifice of the coronary sinus, and even along both atrioventricular rings. Notwithstanding the fact that cholinergic nerve fibers and axons clearly predominate in the mouse CCS, adrenergic nerve fibers and axons are abundant therein as well. Altogether, these results provide new insight into the anatomical basis of the neural control of the mouse CCS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pauza","given":"Dainius H."},{"family":"Saburkina","given":"Inga"},{"family":"Rysevaite","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Inokaitis","given":"Hermanas"},{"family":"Jokubauskas","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Jalife","given":"José"},{"family":"Pauziene","given":"Neringa"}],"citation-key":"Pauza2013","container-title":"Autonomic Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1016/j.autneu.2013.01.006","ISSN":"15660702","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,1]]},"page":"32-47","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Neuroanatomy of the murine cardiac conduction system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566070213000088","volume":"176"},
  {"id":"Pauziene2016","abstract":"© 2015 Anatomical Society. The rabbit is widely used in experimental cardiac physiology, but the neuroanatomy of the rabbit heart remains insufficiently examined. This study aimed to ascertain the architecture of the intrinsic nerve plexus in the walls and septum of rabbit cardiac ventricles. In 51 rabbit hearts, a combined approach involving: (i) histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining of intrinsic neural structures in total cardiac ventricles; (ii) immunofluorescent labelling of intrinsic nerves, nerve fibres (NFs) and neuronal somata (NS); and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of intrinsic ventricular nerves and NFs was used. Mediastinal nerves access the ventral and lateral surfaces of both ventricles at a restricted site between the root of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The dorsal surface of both ventricles is supplied by several epicardial nerves extending from the left dorsal ganglionated nerve subplexus on the dorsal left atrium. Ventral accessing nerves are thicker and more numerous than dorsal nerves. Intrinsic ventricular NS are rare on the conus arteriosus and the root of the pulmonary trunk. The number of ventricular NS ranged from 11 to 220 per heart. Four chemical phenotypes of NS within ventricular ganglia were identified, i.e. ganglionic cells positive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and biphenotypic, i.e. positive for both ChAT/nNOS and for ChAT/tyrosine hydroxylase. Clusters of small intensely fluorescent cells are distributed within or close to ganglia on the root of the pulmonary trunk, but not on the conus arteriosus. The largest and most numerous intrinsic nerves proceed within the epicardium. Scarce nerves were found near myocardial blood vessels, but the myocardium contained only a scarce meshwork of NFs. In the endocardium, large numbers of thin nerves and NFs proceed along the bundle of His and both its branches up to the apex of the ventricles. The endocardial meshwork of fine NFs was approximately eight times denser than the myocardial meshwork. Adrenergic NFs predominate considerably in all layers of the ventricular walls and septum, whereas NFs of other neurochemical phenotypes were in the minority and their amount differed between the epicardium, myocardium and endocardium. The densities of NFs positive for nNOS and ChAT were similar in the epicardium and endocardium, but NFs positive for nNOS in the myocardium were eight times more abundant than NFs positive for ChAT. Potentially sensory NFs positive for both calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P were sparse in the myocardial layer, but numerous in epicardial nerves and particularly abundant within the endocardium. Electron microscopic observations demonstrate that intrinsic ventricular nerves have a distinctive morphology, which may be attributed to remodelling of the peripheral nerves after their access into the ventricular wall. In conclusion, the rabbit ventricles display complex structural organization of intrinsic ventricular nerves, NFs and ganglionic cells. The results provide a basic anatomical background for further functional analysis of the intrinsic nervous system in the cardiac ventricles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pauziene","given":"Neringa"},{"family":"Alaburda","given":"Paulius"},{"family":"Rysevaite-Kyguoliene","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Pauza","given":"Audrys G."},{"family":"Inokaitis","given":"Hermanas"},{"family":"Masaityte","given":"Aiste"},{"family":"Rudokaite","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Saburkina","given":"Inga"},{"family":"Plisiene","given":"Jurgita"},{"family":"Pauza","given":"Dainius H"}],"citation-key":"Pauziene2016","container-title":"Journal of Anatomy","DOI":"10.1111/joa.12400","ISSN":"14697580","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"26-46","title":"Innervation of the rabbit cardiac ventricles","type":"article-journal","volume":"228"},

  {"id":"Payne2017","abstract":"Cefepime is a widely used antibiotic with neurotoxicity attributed to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and exhibit concentration-dependent ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonism. Neurotoxic symptoms include depressed consciousness, encephalopathy, aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and coma. Data suggest that up to 15% of ICU patients treated with cefepime may experience these adverse effects. Risk factors include renal dysfunction, excessive dosing, preexisting brain injury, and elevated serum cefepime concentrations. We aimed to characterize the clinical course of cefepime neurotoxicity and response to interventions. A librarian-assisted search identified publications describing cefepime-associated neurotoxicity from January 1980 to February 2016 using the CINAHL and MEDLINE databases. Search terms included cefepime, neurotoxicity, encephalopathy, seizures, delirium, coma, non-convulsive status epilepticus, myoclonus, confusion, aphasia, agitation, and death. Two reviewers independently assessed identified articles for eligibility and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) for data reporting. Of the 123 citations identified, 37 (representing 135 patient cases) were included. Patients had a median age of 69 years, commonly had renal dysfunction (80%) and required intensive care (81% of patients with a reported location). All patients exhibited altered mental status, with reduced consciousness (47%), myoclonus (42%), and confusion (42%) being the most common symptoms. All 98 patients (73% of cohort) with electroencephalography had abnormalities, including non-convulsive status epilepticus (25%), myoclonic status epilepticus (7%), triphasic waves (40%), and focal sharp waves (39%). As per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing guidance, 48% of patients were overdosed; however, 26% experienced neurotoxicity despite appropriate dosing. Median cefepime serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were 45 mg/L (n = 21) and 13 mg/L (n = 4), respectively. Symptom improvement occurred in 89% of patients, and 87% survived to hospital discharge. The median delay from starting the drug to symptom onset was 4 days, and resolution occurred a median of 2 days after the intervention, which included cefepime discontinuation, antiepileptic administration, or hemodialysis. Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity is challenging to recognize in the critically ill due to widely varying symptoms that are common in ICU patients. This adverse reaction can occur despite appropriate dosing, usually resolves with drug interruption, but may require additional interventions such as antiepileptic drug administration or dialysis.","author":[{"family":"Payne","given":"Lauren E."},{"family":"Gagnon","given":"David J."},{"family":"Riker","given":"Richard R."},{"family":"Seder","given":"David B."},{"family":"Glisic","given":"Elizabeth K."},{"family":"Morris","given":"Jane G."},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Gilles L."}],"citation-key":"Payne2017","container-title":"Critical Care","DOI":"10.1186/s13054-017-1856-1","ISBN":"1305401718561","ISSN":"1466609X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-8","PMID":"29137682","publisher":"Critical Care","title":"Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity: A systematic review","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"Peguero2017","abstract":"Background Current electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have low sensitivity. Objectives The goal of this study was to test a new method to improve the diagnostic performance of the electrocardiogram. Methods The study was divided into 2 groups, a test and a validation cohort. In the test cohort, 94 patients were analyzed, including 47 with the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis and 47 with normal blood pressure at admission. Echocardiography was used to estimate the left ventricular mass index. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used for comparison of single and combined leads. The McNemar test was used to assess agreement among the ECG criteria against the left ventricular mass index. The proposed ECG criteria involved measuring the amplitude of the deepest S wave (SD) in any single lead and adding it to the S wave amplitude of lead V4(SV4). Currently accepted LVH ECG criteria such as Cornell voltage and Sokolow-Lyon were used for comparison. The validation cohort consisted of 122 consecutive patients referred for an echocardiogram regardless of the admitting diagnosis. Results The SDwas the most accurate single lead measurement for the diagnosis of LVH (AUC: 0.80; p < 0.001). When both cohorts were analyzed, the SD + SV4criteria outperformed Cornell voltage with a significantly higher sensitivity (62% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% to 72%] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24% to 46%]).

  {"id":"Pencina2011","abstract":"Appropriate quantification of added usefulness offered by new markers included in risk prediction algorithms is a problem of active research and debate. Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail.In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example.In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.

  {"id":"Peng2022","abstract":"Clustering is a powerful machine learning method for discovering similar patterns according to the proximity of elements in feature space. It is widely used in computer science, bioscience, geoscience, and economics. Although the state-of-the-art partition-based and connectivity-based clustering methods have been developed, weak connectivity and heterogeneous density in data impede their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a boundary-seeking Clustering algorithm using the local Direction Centrality (CDC). It adopts a density-independent metric based on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed cages to bind the connections of internal points, thereby preventing cross-cluster connections and separating weakly-connected clusters. We demonstrate the validity of CDC by detecting complex structured clusters in challenging synthetic datasets, identifying cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data, recognizing speakers on voice corpuses, and testifying on various types of real-world benchmarks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Dehua"},{"family":"Gui","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dehe"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yuncheng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Zichen"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Huayi"}],"citation-key":"Peng2022","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-33136-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,16]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"5455","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Clustering by measuring local direction centrality for data with heterogeneous density and weak connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33136-9","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Penninx2017","abstract":"Depression's burden of disease goes beyond functioning and quality of life and extends to somatic health. Results from longitudinal cohort studies converge in illustrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) subsequently increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with about 80%. The impact of MDD on cardiovascular health may be partly explained by mediating mechanisms such as unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, therapy non-compliance) and unfavorable pathophysiological disturbances (autonomic, HPA-axis, metabolic and immuno-inflammatory dysregulations). A summary of the literature findings as well as relevant results from the large-scale Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2981) are presented. Persons with MDD have significantly worse lifestyles as well as more pathophysiological disturbances as compared to healthy controls. Some of these differences seem to be specific for (typical versus ‘atypical’, or antidepressant treated versus drug-naive) subgroups of MDD patients. Alternative explanations are also present, namely undetected confounding, iatrogenic effects or ‘third factors’ such as genetics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Penninx","given":"Brenda W.J.H."}],"citation-key":"Penninx2017","container-title":"Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.003","ISSN":"18737528","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"277-286","title":"Depression and cardiovascular disease: Epidemiological evidence on their linking mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.07.003","volume":"74"},
  {"id":"Perez-Alday2019","abstract":"Aim: Our goal was to investigate the effect of a global XYZ median beat construction and the heart vector origin point definition on predictive accuracy of ECG biomarkers of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk In Community study participants with analyzable digital ECGs were included (n = 15,768; 55% female, 73% white, mean age 54.2 ± 5.8 y). We developed an algorithm to automatically detect the heart vector origin point on a median beat. Three different approaches to construct a global XYZ beat and two methods to locate origin point were compared. Global electrical heterogeneity was measured by sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST), spatial QRS-T angle, and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) magnitude, azimuth, and elevation. Adjudicated SCD served as the primary outcome. Results: There was high intra-observer (kappa 0.972) and inter-observer (kappa 0.984) agreement in a heart vector origin definition between an automated algorithm and a human. QRS was wider in a median beat that was constructed using R-peak alignment than in time-coherent beat (88.1 ± 16.7 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P < 0.0001), and on a median beat constructed using QRS-onset as a zeroed baseline, vs. isoelectric origin point (86.7 ± 15.9 vs. 83.7 ± 15.9 ms; P < 0.0001). ROC AUC was significantly larger for QRS, QT, peak QRS-T angle, SVG elevation, and SAI QRST if measured on a time-coherent median beat, and for SAI QRST and SVG magnitude if measured on a median beat using isoelectric origin point. Conclusion: Time-coherent global XYZ median beat with physiologically meaningful definition of the heart vector's origin point improved predictive accuracy of SCD biomarkers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Perez-Alday","given":"Erick Andres"},{"family":"Li-Pershing","given":"Yin"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Aron"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tiffany L."},{"family":"Gonzales","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Newton","given":"Kelley"},{"family":"Tereshchenko","given":"Larisa G."}],"citation-key":"Perez-Alday2019","container-title":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.11.013","ISSN":"18790534","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"127-138","PMID":"30472495","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Importance of the heart vector origin point definition for an ECG analysis: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010482518303755","volume":"104"},

This disease is rare in the pediatric population. The objective of this study was to provide a clinical framework for the evaluation and treatment of children with this disorder. A systematic approach to the diagnosis of painful ophthalmoplegia in children is proposed. Methods We present a 15-year-old girl whose clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings support a diagnosis of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome as defined by the 2013 International Classification of Headache Disorders (Third Edition, ICHD-3 beta) diagnostic criteria. An exhaustive systematic literature search based on these criteria yielded 15 additional cases of Tolosa–Hunt syndrome in children. Clinical, demographic, and radiological features were retrospectively analyzed. The results and statistical analyses are reported. Results A total of 16 individuals were included in the final analysis. This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric Tolosa–Hunt syndrome. It highlights demographic, clinical, and radiological features of this disease in children and underscores areas of the literature where evidence is still lacking. Conclusions Overall, Tolosa–Hunt syndrome seems to follow a similar course in children compared to adults. The diagnostic approach and treatment require specific considerations.

  {"id":"Perlis2016","abstract":"Suicide is the second leading cause of death, worldwide, for those between the ages of 24 and 44 y old. In 2013, more than 41,000 suicides occurred in the United States. These statistics underscore the need to 1) understand why people die by suicide and 2) identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable. While it has been posited that sleep disturbance may represent one such factor, systematic research in this arena did not begin until the 2000s. Since that time, sleep disturbance has been reliably identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. While insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disorders have each been found to contribute to the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, it is also possible that these factors share some common variance. One possibility is that sleep disturbance results in being awake at night, and being awake at night also confers risk. The hypothesis proffered here is that being awake when one is not biologically prepared to be so results in \"hypofrontality\" and diminished executive function, and that this represents a common pathway to suicidal ideation and behavior. Such a proposition is highly testable under a variety of possible protocols. The current review summarizes the extant literature on suicide rates by time-of-day, and discusses circadian, psychosocial, and neurocognitive explanations of risk. Such a focus promises to enhance our understanding of how sleep disturbance may confer risk, allows for the identification of future lines of research, and further justifies the need for interventions that promote good sleep continuity among at-risk individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Perlis","given":"Michael L"},{"family":"Grandner","given":"Michael A"},{"family":"Chakravorty","given":"Subhajit"},{"family":"Bernert","given":"Rebecca A"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Gregory K"},{"family":"Thase","given":"Michael E"}],"citation-key":"Perlis2016","container-title":"Sleep Medicine Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.smrv.2015.10.003","ISSN":"10870792","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]},"page":"101-107","title":"Suicide and sleep: Is it a bad thing to be awake when reason sleeps?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079215001471","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"Perloff2011","abstract":"Dextrocardia was known in the 17th century and was 1 of the first congenital malformations of the heart to be recognized. Fifty years elapsed before Matthew Baillie published his account of complete transposition in a human of the thoracic and abdominal viscera to the opposite side from what is natural. In 1858, Thomas Peacock stated that \"the heart may be congenitally misplaced in various ways, occupying either an unusual position within the thorax, or being situated external to that cavity.\" In 1915, Maude Abbott described ectopia cordis, and Richard Paltauf's remarkable illustrations distinguished the various types of dextrocardia. In 1928, the first useful classification of the cardiac malpositions was proposed, and in 1966, Elliott et al's radiologic classification set the stage for clinical recognition. The first section of this review deals with the 3 basic cardiac malpositions in the presence of bilateral asymmetry. The second section deals with cardiac malpositions in the presence of bilateral left-sidedness or right-sidedness.

  {"id":"Peters1990","abstract":"Blood pressure is usually well maintained during epidural or spinal anesthesia even in the presence of extensive sympathetic blockade. The authors investigated whether hormonal systems support arterial pressure and how the circulation copes with a hypoxic challenge when activation of the sympathetic nervous system is selectively impaired by neural blockade. Accordingly, the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and combined with hypoxia were evaluated in seven awake trained dogs. On different days, either bupivacaine 0.5% (8-12 ml) or saline (placebo) were randomly injected epidurally and the effects evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, as well as on hormone plasma concentrations (vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin) during both normoxia and hypoxia. During epidural anesthesia alone, vasopressin increased tenfold (1.7 pg/ml ± 1.0 SD to 16.8 ± 13.8 P < 0.05), norepinephrine decreased (90 pg/ml ± 31 to 61 ± 28, P < 0.05) while epinephrine and renin concentrations remained unchanged. Mean arterial and pulse pressure decreased by 13 mmHg and 23 mmHg (P < 0.05), respectively. In dogs without sympathetic blockade (saline group), hypoxemia (Pa(O2): 31 ± 4 mmHg) evoked an increase in mean blood pressure by 37 mmHg ± 8 and heart rate by 50 beats per min ± 17. In contrast, in the presence of sympathetic blockade but with a similar degree of hypoxemia, blood pressure failed to increase (+1 mmHg ± 14) and heart rate rose by only 15 beats per min ± 11. These differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Hypoxemia induced a similar hypocarbia (Pa(CO2): 25 mmHg) in both groups, indicating that the ventilatory response to hypoxemia was preserved after epidural blockade. During hypoxemia vasopressin concentrations increased 35-fold to 64 pg/ml ± 38 (P < 0.0001) compared to base line only during epidural anesthesia, but not after epidural saline (2 pg/ml ± 2), while other hormones showed no significant differences. The authors conclude that high epidural anesthesia in awake unsedated dogs: 1) almost completely abolishes the normal cardiovascular response to hypoxemia while promoting vasopressin secretion; 2) preserves the ventilatory response to hypoxemia; and 3) is associated with increased vasopressin concentrations, most likely to compensate for decreased cardiac filling and/or arterial blood pressure when sympathoadrenal responses are impaired. Thus, the changes in cardiovascular vital signs in response to severe hypoxemia are markedly blunted when spinal sympathetic outflow is selectively eliminated by epidural anesthesia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"J."},{"family":"Kutkuhn","given":"B."},{"family":"Medert","given":"H.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an EHR score can improve CAD prediction and reclassification 1 year before diagnosis, beyond conventional clinical guidelines as determined by the pooled cohort equations (PCE) and a polygenic risk score for CAD. Methods: We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation. Results: Compared with the PCE, the EHR score improved CAD prediction by 12% in the BioMe Biobank and by 9% in the UK Biobank. The EHR score reclassified 25.8% and 15.2% individuals in each cohort respectively, compared with the PCE score. We observed larger improvements in the EHR score over the PCE in a subgroup of individuals with low CAD risk, with 20% increased discrimination and 34.4% increased reclassification. In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. Conclusions: The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Petrazzini","given":"Ben O."},{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Kumardeep"},{"family":"Márquez-Luna","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Forrest","given":"Iain S."},{"family":"Rocheleau","given":"Ghislain"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Judy"},{"family":"Narula","given":"Jagat"},{"family":"Nadkarni","given":"Girish"},{"family":"Do","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"Petrazzini2022","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2022.01.021","ISSN":"15583597","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,29]]},"page":"1155-1166","PMID":"35331410","publisher":"American College of Cardiology Foundation Washington D.C.","title":"Coronary Risk Estimation Based on Clinical Data in Electronic Health Records","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.01.021","volume":"79"},

The disease is characterized by massive epithelial destruction, which results in gut barrier failure. The exact molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this complex disease are poorly understood. Recent studies have provided significant insight into our understanding of the pathogenesis of NEC. Endogenous mediators such as prostanoids, cyclooxygenases, and nitric oxide may play a role in the development of gut barrier failure.

  {"id":"Pfeffer1992","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction after myocardial infarction are major predictors of death. In experimental and clinical studies, longterm therapy with the angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor captopril attenuated ventricular dilatation and remodeling. We investigated whether captopril could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction.\\n\\nMETHODS: Within 3 to 16 days after myocardial infarction, 2231 patients with ejection fractions of 40 percent or less but without overt heart failure or symptoms of myocardial ischemia were randomly assigned to receive doubleblind treatment with either placebo (1116 patients) or captopril (1115 patients) and were followed for an average of 42 months.\\n\\nRESULTS: Mortality from all causes was significantly reduced in the captopril group (228 deaths, or 20 percent) as compared with the placebo group (275 deaths, or 25 percent); the reduction in risk was 19 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 32 percent; P = 0.019). In addition, the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events was consistently reduced in the captopril group.

  {"id":"Phillips2017","abstract":"The association of irregular sleep schedules with circadian timing and academic performance has not been systematically examined. We studied 61 undergraduates for 30 days using sleep diaries, and quantified sleep regularity using a novel metric, the sleep regularity index (SRI). In the most and least regular quintiles, circadian phase and light exposure were assessed using salivary dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and wrist-worn photometry, respectively. DLMO occurred later (00:08 ± 1:54 vs. 21:32 ± 1:48; p < 0.003); the daily sleep propensity rhythm peaked later (06:33 ± 0:19 vs. 04:45 ± 0:11; p < 0.005); and light rhythms had lower amplitude (102 ± 19 lux vs. 179 ± 29 lux; p < 0.005) in Irregular compared to Regular sleepers. A mathematical model of the circadian pacemaker and its response to light was used to demonstrate that Irregular vs. Regular group differences in circadian timing were likely primarily due to their different patterns of light exposure. A positive correlation (r = 0.37; p < 0.004) between academic performance and SRI was observed. These findings show that irregular sleep and light exposure patterns in college students are associated with delayed circadian rhythms and lower academic performance. Moreover, the modeling results reveal that light-based interventions may be therapeutically effective in improving sleep regularity in this population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Andrew J.K."},{"family":"Clerx","given":"William M."},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"Conor S."},{"family":"Sano","given":"Akane"},{"family":"Barger","given":"Laura K."},{"family":"Picard","given":"Rosalind W."},{"family":"Lockley","given":"Steven W."},{"family":"Klerman","given":"Elizabeth B."},{"family":"Czeisler","given":"Charles A."}],"citation-key":"Phillips2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-03171-4","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"page":"1-13","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"Irregular sleep/wake patterns are associated with poorer academic performance and delayed circadian and sleep/wake timing","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"Pibarot2019","abstract":"Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) occurs when the effective orifice area (EOA) of the prosthetic valve is too small in relation to a patient's body size, thus resulting in high residual postoperative pressure gradients across the prosthesis. Severe PPM occurs in 2% to 20% of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is associated with 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in the risk of mortality and heart failure rehospitalization. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the role of multimodality imaging in the assessment, prediction, prevention, and management of PPM following AVR. The risk of PPM can be anticipated at the time of AVR by calculating the predicted indexed from the normal reference value of EOA of the selected prosthesis and patient's body surface area. The strategies to prevent PPM at the time of surgical AVR include: 1) implanting a newer generation of prosthetic valve with better hemodynamic; 2) enlarging the aortic root or annulus to accommodate a larger prosthetic valve; or 3) performing TAVR rather than surgical AVR. The identification and quantitation of PPM as well as its distinction versus prosthetic valve stenosis is primarily based on transthoracic echocardiography, but important information may be obtained from other imaging modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography. PPM is characterized by high transprosthetic velocity and gradients, normal EOA, small indexed EOA, and normal leaflet morphology and mobility. Transesophageal echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography are particularly helpful to assess prosthetic valve leaflet morphology and mobility, which is a cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between PPM and pathologic valve obstruction. Severe symptomatic PPM following AVR with a bioprosthetic valve may be treated by redo surgery or the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure with fracturing of the surgical valve stent.","author":[{"family":"Pibarot","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Magne","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Leipsic","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Côté","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Blanke","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Thourani","given":"Vinod H."},{"family":"Hahn","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"Pibarot2019","container-title":"JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcmg.2018.10.020","ISSN":"18767591","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"149-162","PMID":"30621987","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Imaging for Predicting and Assessing Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch After Aortic Valve Replacement","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"Pimple2014","abstract":"Background Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse prognosis in coronary artery disease patients. Anger is thought to be a trigger of acute coronary syndromes and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk; however, little direct evidence exists for a link between anger and myocardial ischemia. Methods [99mTc]-sestamibi single-photon emission tomography was performed at rest, after mental stress (a social stressor with a speech task) and after exercise/pharmacologic stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed-difference score, the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory was used to assess different anger dimensions. Results The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female, and 60% were non-white. After adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, coronary artery disease severity, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, each IQR increment in state-anger score was associated with 0.36 U-adjusted increase in ischemia as measured by the summed-difference score (95% CI 0.14-0.59); the corresponding association for trait anger was 0.95 (95% CI 0.21-1.69). Anger expression scales were not associated with ischemia. None of the anger dimensions was related to ischemia during exercise/pharmacologic stress. Conclusion Anger, both as an emotional state and as a personality trait, is significantly associated with propensity to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress but not during exercise/pharmacologic stress.

  {"id":"Pimple2015","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a common phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and an emerging prognostic factor. Mental stress ischemia is correlated with ambulatory ischemia. However, whether it is related to angina symptoms during daily life has not been examined. METHODS: We assessed angina frequency (past month) in 98 post-myocardial infarction (MI) subjects (age 18-60 years) using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Patients underwent [(99m)Tc]sestamibi SPECT perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Summed scores of perfusion abnormalities were obtained by observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years, 50% were female and 60% were non-white. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CAD severity, depressive, anger, and anxiety symptoms, each 1-point increase in mental stress-SDS was associated with 1.73-unit increase in the angina frequency score (95% CI: 0.09-3.37) and 17% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.38). Depressive symptoms were associated with 12% higher odds of being in a higher angina frequency category (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21). In contrast, exercise/pharmacological stress-induced SDS was not associated with angina frequency. CONCLUSION: Among young and middle-aged post-MI patients, myocardial ischemia induced by mental stress in the lab, but not by exercise/pharmacological stress, is associated with higher frequency of retrospectively reported angina during the day. Psychosocial stressors related to mental stress ischemia may be important contributory factor to daily angina.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Rooks","given":"Cherie"},{"family":"Douglas Bremner","given":"J."},{"family":"Nye","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Ibeanu","given":"Ijeoma"},{"family":"Raggi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"}],"citation-key":"Pimple2015","container-title":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.02.007","ISBN":"0022-3999","ISSN":"00223999","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5]]},"page":"433-437","PMID":"25727240","title":"Angina and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727240","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"Pimple2018","abstract":"Background: Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is a frequent phenomenon in patients with coronary artery disease. Women with coronary artery disease tend to have more mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and more chest pain/anginal symptoms than men, but whether the association between mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia and angina burden differs in women and men is unknown. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with experimental manipulation of 950 individuals with stable coronary artery disease. Chest pain/angina frequency in the previous 4 weeks was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire's angina-frequency subscale. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was assessed with myocardial perfusion imaging during mental stress (standardized public speaking task). Presence of mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia was based on expert readers and established criteria. A conventional (exercise or pharmacologic) stress test was used as a control condition. Results: Overall, 338 individuals (37%) reported angina; 112 (12%) developed mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia, and 256 (29%) developed conventional stress ischemia. Women who reported angina had almost double the probability to develop mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (19% vs 10%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.46), whereas there was no such difference in men (11% vs 11%, adjusted prevalence rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.82). No association was found between angina symptoms and conventional stress ischemia for women or men. Results for ischemia as a continuous variable were similar. Conclusions: In women, but not in men, anginal symptoms may be a marker of vulnerability toward ischemia induced by psychologic stress. These results highlight the psychosocial origins of angina in women and may have important implications for the management and prognosis of women with angina.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Wilmot","given":"Kobina"},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Al Mheid","given":"Ibhar"},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Ernest V."},{"family":"Nye","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Puja"},{"family":"Raggi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Pisters2010","abstract":"OBJECTIVE Despite extensive use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and the increased bleeding risk associated with such OAC use, no handy quantification tool for assessing this risk exists. We aimed to develop a practical risk score to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding (intracranial, hospitalization, hemoglobin decrease > 2 g/L, and/or transfusion) in a cohort of real-world patients with AF. METHODS Based on 3,978 patients in the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up, all univariate bleeding risk factors in this cohort were used in a multivariate analysis along with historical bleeding risk factors. A new bleeding risk score termed HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) was calculated, incorporating risk factors from the derivation cohort. RESULTS Fifty-three (1.5%) major bleeds occurred during 1-year follow-up. The annual bleeding rate increased with increasing risk factors. The predictive accuracy in the overall population using significant risk factors in the derivation cohort (C statistic 0.72) was consistent when applied in several subgroups. Application of the new bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) gave similar C statistics except where patients were receiving antiplatelet agents alone or no antithrombotic therapy, with C statistics of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. CONCLUSION This simple, novel bleeding risk score (HAS-BLED) provides a practical tool to assess the individual bleeding risk of real-world patients with AF, potentially supporting clinical decision making regarding antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pisters","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Deirdre A."},{"family":"Nieuwlaat","given":"Robby"},{"family":"De Vos","given":"Cees B."},{"family":"Crijns","given":"Harry J.G.M."},{"family":"Lip","given":"Gregory Y.H."}],"citation-key":"Pisters2010","container-title":"Chest","DOI":"10.1378/chest.10-0134","ISBN":"1931-3543 (Electronic)\\r0012-3692 (Linking)","ISSN":"19313543","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"page":"1093-1100","PMID":"20299623","title":"A novel user-friendly score (HAS-BLED) to assess 1-year risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: The euro heart survey","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299623","volume":"138"},
  {"id":"Polizzotto2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the cause of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and a form of Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD). Recently a KSHV-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) distinct from KSHV-MCD was reported. METHODS: We prospectively characterized the clinical, laboratory, virologic and immunologic features of KICS by evaluating symptomatic adults with KSHV using a prespecified definition. These features and overall survival were compared with controls from 2 prospectively characterized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cohorts, including 1 with KSHV coinfection. RESULTS: All 10 KICS subjects were HIV infected males; 5 had HIV viral load (VL) suppressed <50 copies mL (median 72, range <50-74 375); all had KS and 2 also had PEL. All had multiple severe symptoms attributable to KICS: median number of symptoms 8 (6-11), median grade of worst symptom 3 (2-4). These included gastrointestinal disturbance (present in 9); edema (9); respiratory (6); and effusions (5). Laboratory abnormalities included anemia (all); hypoalbuminemia (all) and thrombocytopenia (6). None developed KSHV-MCD; 6 died with median survival from KICS diagnosis 13.6 months. KICS subjects compared with controls had more severe symptoms; lower hemoglobin and albumin; higher C-reactive protein; higher KSHV VL; elevated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10; and an increased risk of death (all P < .05). Anemia and hypoalbuminemia at presentation were independently associated with early death. CONCLUSIONS: KICS subjects demonstrated diverse severe symptoms, a high rate of KSHV-associated tumors, high mortality, and a distinct IL-6/IL-10 signature. KICS may be an important unrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality, including symptoms previously ascribed to HIV. Exploration of KSHV-directed therapy is warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Polizzotto","given":"Mark N"},{"family":"Uldrick","given":"Thomas S"},{"family":"Wyvill","given":"Kathleen M"},{"family":"Aleman","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Vickie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Whitby","given":"Denise"},{"family":"Pittaluga","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Elaine S"},{"family":"Millo","given":"Corina"},{"family":"Tosato","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Little","given":"Richard F"},{"family":"Steinberg","given":"Seth M"},{"family":"Sereti","given":"Irini"},{"family":"Yarchoan","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"Polizzotto2015","container-title":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","DOI":"10.1093/cid/civ996","ISSN":"15376591","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"730-738","PMID":"26658701","title":"Clinical Features and Outcomes of Patients with Symptomatic Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated Inflammation: Prospective Characterization of KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS)","type":"article-journal","volume":"62"},

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: 12 681 white and African-American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and two ancillary studies. Methods: Participants provided information on SES and place of residence in childhood and young (30-40 years) and mature (45+) adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighbourhood SES information. Multiple imputation (MI) was used for missing data. Linear regression and adjusted geometric means were used to estimate the effects of SES on inflammatory risk marker levels. Results: Graded, statistically significant associations were observed between greater cumulative life-course exposure to low education and social class and elevated levels of fibrinogen and WBC among white participants. Stronger graded, statistically significant associations were observed between low adult education, social class and neighbourhood SES and elevated inflammatory levels. Associations were weaker and less consistent in African-Americans. Covariate adjustment attenuated results but many associations remained strong. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cumulative exposure to adverse SES conditions across the life course and low adult SES are associated with an elevated systemic inflammatory burden in adulthood. Chronic systemic inflammation may be one pathway linking low life-course SES and elevated cardiovascular disease risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollitt","given":"R.

  {"id":"Portaluppi2012","abstract":"The functional organization of the cardiovascular system shows clear circadian rhythmicity. These and other circadian rhythms at all levels of organization are orchestrated by a central biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Preservation of the normal circadian time structure from the level of the cardiomyocyte to the organ system appears to be essential for cardiovascular health and cardiovascular disease prevention. Myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarct, and sudden cardiac death are much greater in incidence than expected in the morning. Moreover, supraventricular and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias of various types show specific day-night patterns, with atrial arrhythmias - premature beats, tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and flutter - generally being of higher frequency during the day than night - and ventricular fibrillation and ventricular premature beats more common, respectively, in the morning and during the daytime activity than sleep span. Furthermore, different circadian patterns of blood pressure are found in arterial hypertension, in relation to different cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Such temporal patterns result from circadian periodicity in pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to predictable-in-time differences in susceptibility-resistance to cyclic environmental stressors that trigger these clinical events. Circadian rhythms also may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular and other medications. Knowledge of 24-h patterns in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality plus circadian rhythm-dependencies of underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms suggests the requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions is not the same throughout the day and night, and should be tailored accordingly to improve outcomes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Portaluppi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Tiseo","given":"Ruana"},{"family":"Smolensky","given":"Michael H"},{"family":"Hermida","given":"Ramón C"},{"family":"Ayala","given":"Diana E"},{"family":"Fabbian","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"Portaluppi2012","container-title":"Sleep Medicine Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.smrv.2011.04.003","ISBN":"1532-2955 (Electronic)\\r1087-0792 (Linking)","ISSN":"10870792","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"151-166","PMID":"21641838","title":"Circadian rhythms and cardiovascular health","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"Porter2004","abstract":"Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of age and gender on the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Background: Previous studies have indicated that PSVT mechanism may be influenced by age and gender, but contemporary data are limited. Methods: In 1,754 patients undergoing catheter ablation of 1,856 PSVTs between 1991 and 2003, the mechanism was classified as atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), or atrial tachycardia (AT). Patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and age <5 years were excluded. Results: The mean age was 45 ± 19 years (range 5-96), and the majority were women (62%). Overall, AVNRT was the predominant mechanism (n = 1,042 [56%]), followed by AVRT (n = 500 [27%]) and AT (n = 315 [17%]). There was a strong relationship between age and PSVT mechanism; the proportion of AVRT in both sexes decreased with age, whereas AVNRT and AT increased (PM .001 by ANOVA). The majority of patients with AVRT were men (273/500 [54.6%]), whereas the majority of patients with AVNRT and AT were women (727/1,042 [70%] and 195/315 [62%], respectively). The distribution of PSVT mechanism was significantly influenced by gender (P < .001). In women, 63% had AVNRT, 20% had AVRT, and 17.0% had AT. In men, 45% had AVNRT, 39% had AVRT, and 17% had AT. AVNRT replaced AVRT as the dominant PSVT mechanism at age 40 in men and at age 10 in women.

  {"id":"Powers2017","abstract":"Endurance exercise training promotes numerous cellular adaptations in both cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers. For example, exercise training fosters changes in mitochondrial function due to increased mitochondrial protein expression and accelerated mitochondrial turnover. Additionally, endurance exercise training alters the abundance of numerous cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in both cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, resulting in a protective phenotype in the active fibers; this exercise-induced protection of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers is often referred to as \"exercise preconditioning.\" As few as 3-5 consecutive days of endurance exercise training result in a preconditioned cardiac phenotype that is sheltered against ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Similarly, endurance exercise training results in preconditioned skeletal muscle fibers that are resistant to a variety of stresses (e.g., heat stress, exercise-induced oxidative stress, and inactivity-induced atrophy). Many studies have probed the mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning of cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers; these studies are important, because they provide an improved understanding of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced preconditioning, which has the potential to lead to innovative pharmacological therapies aimed at minimizing stress-induced injury to cardiac and skeletal muscle. This review summarizes the development of exercise-induced protection of cardiac myocytes and skeletal muscle fibers and highlights the putative mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced protection in the heart and skeletal muscles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Powers","given":"Scott K."}],"citation-key":"Powers2017","container-title":"Journal of Applied Physiology","DOI":"10.1152/japplphysiol.00418.2017","ISSN":"8750-7587","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"460-472","title":"Exercise: Teaching myocytes new tricks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jappl.org","volume":"123"},

  {"id":"Pratt2014","abstract":"OBJECTIVES To review left ventricular assist device physiology, initial postoperative management, common complications, trouble shooting and management of hypotension, and other common ICU problems. DATA SOURCE Narrative review of relevant medical literature. DATA SYNTHESIS Left ventricular assist devices prolong the lives of patients with end-stage heart failure, and their use is increasing. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices have replaced first-generation pulsatile devices. These patients present unique management concerns. In the immediate postimplant period, care must be taken to support the unassisted right ventricle. Invasive monitors for blood pressure, pulmonary artery catheterization, and echocardiography are essential to optimize left ventricular assist device settings and cardiac performance. Anticoagulation is necessary to prevent devastating thrombotic and embolic complications, but bleeding is a major source of morbidity due to inherent bleeding diatheses and prescribed anticoagulants. Infection of the device can be life threatening, and all infections must be aggressively treated to avoid seeding the device. Patients are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias because of their underlying disease, as well as the placement and position of the inflow cannula. Aortic valve stenosis and insufficiency develop over time and can lead to thrombosis or heart failure. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation with chest compressions must be performed with care or not at all due to risk of dislodging the device. CONCLUSION Intensivists are increasingly likely to encounter patients requiring mechanical circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices at various points in the trajectory of their disease, from the immediate postimplant period to subsequent admissions for complications, and at end of life. A basic understanding of left ventricular assist device physiology is essential to the safe and effective care of these patients.","author":[{"family":"Pratt","given":"Alexandra K."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nimesh S."},{"family":"Boyce","given":"Steven W."}],"citation-key":"Pratt2014","container-title":"Critical Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.ccm.0000435675.91305.76","ISBN":"1530-0293 (Electronic)\\r0090-3493 (Linking)","ISSN":"00903493","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"158-168","PMID":"24240731","title":"Left ventricular assist device management in the ICU","type":"article-journal","volume":"42"},

These are the times when rigorous scholarship has been brought to bear on the field (with great improvement in the quality of research) and when medicine is disappearing from its own history. These are the times when, in general, historians know only their field of specialization and physicians know only how to treat diseases. These are the times of locused competence and general ignorance. The history of medicine has become a field where historians write for other historians who, limited by their ignorance of medicine, cultivate mainly its sociological and political aspects. Physicians, on the other hand, are taught that only what is ‘relevant’ counts, and practise medicine in ignorance of their past because the history of medicine does not seem to have any immediate utility (1). The few among them who attempt to do something in what is, after all, the history of their profession, are often considered, by historians, naive dabblers who lack knowledge and capacity for the task. This state of affairs came to be fairly recently. It began with a positive development in medical historiography: the realization that the history of medicine was not a discipline that helped to treat diseases but the history of one of man's endeavours, in other words, that is was not a branch of medicine but of history.","author":[{"family":"Prioreschi","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"prioreschi1992","container-title":"Medical Hypotheses","DOI":"10.1016/0306-9877(92)90079-R","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"eng","page":"97-101","source":"Primo","title":"Physicians, historians, and the history of medicine","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"Priori1990","abstract":"The relative influence of α- and β-adrenergic receptor activation in eliciting early (EADs) and delayed (DADs) afterdepolarizations was assessed using intracellular microelectrode recordings in isolated adult canine ventricular myocytes. Normoxic myocytes were exposed to the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10-8-10-6 M) or the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10-9-10-6 M) during pacing at different frequencies (0.5-4 Hz). α-Adrenergic stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent prolongation of action potential duration but failed to induce either EADs or DADs. β-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol at low concentrations (10-9-10-8 M) induced a prolongation of the action potential, whereas higher concentrations (10-7 and 10-6 M) resulted in a marked shortening. Isoproterenol elicited single or multiple (2-5) DADs at concentrations from 10-8 to 10-6 M, with a corresponding increase in the amplitude of the DADs and decrease in the coupling interval as cells were paced at increasing rates. DADs often initiated and maintained sustained triggered rhythms that spontaneously terminated. Isoproterenol (10-8 - 10-6 M) also elicited EADs in 80% of cells at the highest concentration utilized (10-6 M) and at intermediate pacing frequencies (1-2 Hz). EADs often occurred with a 2:1 or 3:1 pattern. EADs and DADs induced by isoproterenol were reversibly abolished by low extracellular sodium, ryanodine (10-6 M), or benzamil (10-4 M), thus indicating that Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and extracellular Na+ concentration are two major factors in the development of both types of afterdepolarizations. The demonstration that EADs can be induced by isoproterenol in ventricular muscle suggest a novel pathway for β-adrenergic receptors to mediate arrhythmogenesis in the intact heart.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Priori","given":"S.

  {"id":"Prystowsky1981","abstract":"In humans, the parasympathetic nervous system predominates over the sympathetic nervous system in control of heart rate, but little is known about the relative influences of cholinergic and adrenergic tone on the electrophysiological properties of the ventricle and atrioventricular (AV) node. Thirteen subjects were studied using standard electrophysiological testing techniques in the control state and after propranolol (0.15 mg/kg, iv) plus atropine (0.03 mg/kg, iv) to assess the effect of autonomic blockade on ventricular and AV nodal refractoriness and AV nodal conduction. Eight subjects received propranolol first (group A) and five were given atropine first (group B). For groups A and B, the spontaneous sinus cycle length significantly decreased from control after administration or propranolol and atropine [813 ± 107 (SD) to 613 ± 57 msec and 842 ± 188 to 637 ± 115 msec, respectively] . Ventricular effective (ERP) and functional (FRP) refractory periods insignificantly increased from control after propranolol was given (group A); however, both ventricular ERP and FRP significantly shortened to less than control values after atropine was added (238 ± 23 to 218 ± 19 msec and 261 ± 22 to 243 ± 17 msec, respectively). Similar results for ventricular refractoriness occurred after administration of atropine and propranolol in group B subjects. The shortest atrial pacing cycle length sustaining 1:1 AV nodal conduction after administration of propranolol and atropine did not significantly change from control values (386 ± 109 to 372 ± 74 msec). These data suggest that (1) resting vagal tone exerts a significant effect on human ventricular refractoriness and the effect can occur in the presence of β-adrenergic blockade, and (2) in contrast to the markedly predominant effect of the parasympathetic nervous system on sinus nodal automaticity, vagal and adrenergic tone exert a balanced effect on resting AV nodal conduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Prystowsky","given":"Eric N"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Warren M"},{"family":"Rinkenberger","given":"Robert L"},{"family":"Heger","given":"James J"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"Douglas P"}],"citation-key":"Prystowsky1981","container-title":"Circ Res","DOI":"10.1161/01.RES.49.2.511","ISBN":"0009-7330 (Print)\\r0009-7330 (Linking)","ISSN":"0009-7330","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"page":"511-518","PMID":"7249285","title":"Effect of autonomic blockade on ventricular retractoriness and atrioventricular nodal conduction in humans.

  {"id":"Pstras2016","abstract":"The Valsalva manoeuvre (VM), a forced expiratory effort against a closed airway, has a wide range of applications in several medical disciplines, including diagnosing heart problems or autonomic nervous system deficiencies. The changes of the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure associated with the manoeuvre result in a complex cardiovascular response with a concomitant action of several regulatory mechanisms. As the main aim of the reflex mechanisms is to control the arterial blood pressure (BP), their action is based primarily on signals from baroreceptors, although they also reflect the activity of pulmonary stretch receptors and, to a lower degree, chemoreceptors, with different mechanisms acting either in synergism or in antagonism depending on the phase of the manoeuvre. A variety of abnormal responses to the VM can be seen in patients with different conditions. Based on the arterial BP and heart rate changes during and after the manoeuvre several dysfunctions can be hence diagnosed or confirmed. The nature of the cardiovascular response to the manoeuvre depends, however, not only on the shape of the cardiovascular system and the autonomic function of the given patient, but also on a number of technical factors related to the execution of the manoeuvre including the duration and level of strain, the body position or breathing pattern. This review of the literature provides a comprehensive analysis of the physiology and pathophysiology of the VM and an overview of its applications.

Background: No study has examined the effects of these genetic variants on CHD in diabetic patients. Methods: We genotyped 15 genetic markers of 12 loci in 3 studies of diabetic patients: the prospective Nurses' Health Study (309 CHD cases, and 544 control subjects) and Health Professional Follow-up Study (345 CHD cases, and 451 control subjects) and the cross-sectional Joslin Heart Study (422 CHD cases, and 435 control subjects). Results: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs4977574 (CDKN2A/2B), rs12526453 (PHACTR1), rs646776 (CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1), rs2259816 (HNF1A), and rs11206510 (PCSK9) showed directionally consistent associations with CHD in the 3 studies, with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.17 to 1.25 (p = 0.03 to 0.0002). None of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached significance in individual or combined analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created by combining the risk alleles of the 5 significantly associated loci. The OR of CHD/GRS unit was 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 1.26; p < 0.0001). Individuals with GRS <8 (19% of diabetic subjects) had almost a 2-fold increase in CHD risk (OR: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.60 to 2.35) as compared with individuals with GRS ≤5 (30% of diabetic subjects). Prediction of CHD was significantly improved (p < 0.001) when the GRS was added to a model including clinical predictors in the combined samples.

  {"id":"Racine2018","abstract":"1. Overview B-splines constitute an appealing method for the nonparametric estimation of a range of statis-tical objects of interest. In this primer we focus our attention on the estimation of a conditional mean, i.e. the 'regression function'. A 'spline' is a function that is constructed piece-wise from polynomial functions. The term comes from the tool used by shipbuilders and drafters to construct smooth shapes having desired properties. Drafters have long made use of a bendable strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form a smooth curve passing through those points. The malleability of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape. We shall rely on a class of splines called 'B-splines' ('basis-splines'). A B-spline function is the maximally differentiable interpolative basis function. The B-spline is a generalization of the Bézier curve (a B-spline with no 'interior knots' is a Bézier curve). B-splines are defined by their 'order' m and number of interior 'knots' N (there are two 'endpoints' which are themselves knots so the total number of knots will be N +2). The degree of the B-spline polynomial will be the spline order m minus one (degree = m − 1). To best appreciate the nature of B-splines, we shall first consider a simple type of spline, the Bézier function, and then move on to the more flexible and powerful generalization, the B-spline itself. We begin with the univariate case in Section 2 where we consider the univariate Bézier function. In Section 3 we turn to the univariate B-spline function, and then in Section 4 we turn to the multivariate case where we also briefly mention how one could handle the presence of categorical predictors. We presume that interest lies in 'regression spline' methodology which differs in a number of ways from 'smoothing splines', both of which are popular in applied settings. The fundamen-tal difference between the two approaches is that smoothing splines explicitly penalize roughness and use the data points themselves as potential knots whereas regression splines place knots at equidistant/equiquantile points. We direct the interested reader to Wahba (1990) for a treatment of smoothing splines. Date: December 18, 2014. These notes are culled from a variety of sources.

Bézier curves We present an overview of Bézier curves which form the basis for the B-splines that follow. We begin with a simple illustration, that of a quadratic Bézier curve. Example 2.1. A quadratic Bézier curve. A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function B(x), given points β 0 , β 1 , and β 2 , where B(x) = β 0 (1 − x) 2 + 2β 1 (1 − x)x + β 2 x 2 = 2 i=0 β i B i (x), x ∈ [0, 1]. The terms B 0 (x) = (1 − x) 2 , B 1 (x) = 2(1 − x)x, and B 2 (x) = x 2 are the 'bases' which is this case turn out to be 'Bernstein polynomials' (Bernstein (1912)). For our purposes the 'control points' β i , i = 0, 1, 2, will be parameters that could be selected by least squares fitting in a regression setting, but more on that later. Consider the following simple example where we plot a quadratic Bézier curve with arbitrary control points: 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Racine","given":"Jeffrey S"}],"citation-key":"Racine2018","DOI":"10.1177/1094428104272636","ISBN":"0031-5826","ISSN":"10944281","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-11","title":"A primer on regression splines","type":"report"},

Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study. Methods We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models. Results During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03-1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05-4.80) and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26-21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (vs referents) was associated with 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14-7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42-6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90-8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13-4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44-2.79).

  {"id":"Ramadan2013a","abstract":"Background--Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that compared with exercise/pharmacological stress-induced myocardial ischemia (PSIMI) that is secondary to the atherosclerotic burden of CAD, MSIMI is primarily due to vasomotor changes. Methods and Results--Patients with angiographically documented CAD underwent 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and following both mental and physical stress testing, performed on separate days. The severity and extent of CAD were quantified using the Gensini and Sullivan scores. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Itamar Inc) was used to assess the digital microvascular tone during mental stress as a ratio of pulse wave amplitude during speech compared with baseline. Measurements were made in a discovery sample (n=225) and verified in a replication sample (n=159). In the pooled (n=384) sample, CAD severity and extent scores were not significantly different between those with and without MSIMI, whereas they were greater in those with compared with those without PSIMI (P < 0.04 for all). The peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was lower in those with compared with those without MSIMI (0.55±0.36 versus 0.76±0.52, P=0.009). In a multivariable analysis, the peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was the only independent predictor of MSIMI (P=0.009), whereas angiographic severity and extent of CAD independently predicted PSIMI. Conclusions--The degree of digital microvascular constriction, and not the angiographic burden of CAD, is associated with MSIMI. Varying causes of MSIMI compared with PSIMI may require different therapeutic interventions that require further study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Sheps","given":"David"},{"family":"Esteves","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Zafari","given":"A.

  {"id":"Ramirez2019","abstract":"Aims: Electrical cardioversion is commonly performed to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is unsuccessful in 10-12% of attempts. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel cardioversion protocol for this arrhythmia. Methods and results: Consecutive elective cardioversion attempts for AF between October 2012 and July 2017 at a tertiary cardiovascular centre before (Phase I) and after (Phase II) implementing the Ottawa AF cardioversion protocol (OAFCP) as an institutional initiative in July 2015 were evaluated. The primary outcome was cardioversion success, defined as ≥2 consecutive sinus beats or atrial-paced beats in patients with implanted cardiac devices. Secondary outcomes were first shock success, sustained success (sinus or atrial-paced rhythm on 12-lead electrocardiogram prior to discharge from hospital), and procedural complications. Cardioversion was successful in 459/500 (91.8%) in Phase I compared with 386/389 (99.2%) in Phase II (P < 0.001). This improvement persisted after adjusting for age, body mass index, amiodarone use, and transthoracic impedance using modified Poisson regression [adjusted relative risk 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11; P < 0.001] and when analysed as an interrupted time series (change in level +9.5%, 95% CI 6.8-12.1%; P < 0.001). The OAFCP was also associated with greater first shock success (88.4% vs. 79.2%; P < 0.001) and sustained success (91.6% vs 84.7%; P=0.002). No serious complications occurred. Conclusion: Implementing the OAFCP was associated with a 7.4% absolute increase in cardioversion success and increases in first shock and sustained success without serious procedural complications.

Cryoglobulinaemia is associated with many illnesses, which can be broadly grouped into infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies; the most common cause is infection with hepatitis C virus. Mixed cryoglobulinaemic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has typical organ involvement (mainly skin, kidney, or peripheral nerve) and circulating cryoglobulins. Cutaneous purpura is the most common manifestation of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. The most frequently affected internal organs are the peripheral nerves, kidneys, and joints. The course varies widely and prognosis is influenced by both cryoglobulinaemic damage to vital organs and by comorbidities associated with underlying diseases. More than 90 of cases of cryoglobulinaemia have a known underlying cause; therefore treatment is focused on the cause of the disorder rather than merely symptomatic relief.

  {"id":"Randall2003","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine how neurons within the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) and posterior atrial ganglionated plexus (PAGP) interact to modulate right atrial chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic function, particularly with respect to their extracardiac vagal and sympathetic efferent neuronal inputs. Surgical ablation of the PAGP (PAGPx) attenuated vagally mediated bradycardia by 26%; it reduced heart rate slowing evoked by vagal stimulation superimposed on sympathetically mediated tachycardia by 36%. RAGP ablation (RAGPx) eliminated vagally mediated bradycardia, while retaining the vagally induced suppression of sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-83%). After combined RAGPx and PAGPx, vagal stimulation still reduced sympathetic-mediated tachycardia (-47%). After RAGPx alone and after PAGPx alone, stimulation of the vagi still produced negative dromotropic effects, although these changes were attenuated compared with the intact state. Negative dromotropic responses to vagal stimulation were further attenuated after combined ablation, but parasympathetic inhibition of atrioventricular nodal conduction was still demonstrable in most animals. Finally, neither RAGPx nor PAGPx altered autonomic regulation of right atrial inotropic function. These data indicate that multiple aggregates of neurons within the intrinsic cardiac nervous system are involved in sinoatrial nodal regulation. Whereas parasympathetic efferent neurons regulating the right atrium, including the sinoatrial node, are primarily located within the RAGP, prejunctional parasympathetic-sympathetic interactions regulating right atrial function also involve neurons within the PAGP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Randall","given":"David C"},{"family":"Brown","given":"David R"},{"family":"McGuirt","given":"A.

  {"id":"Reddy2015","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of feedback, the literature suggests that there is inadequate feedback in graduate medical education. OBJECTIVE: We explored barriers and facilitators that residents in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and surgery experience with giving and receiving feedback during their clinical training. METHODS: Residents from 3 geographically diverse teaching institutions were recruited to participate in focus groups in 2012. Open-ended questions prompted residents to describe their experiences with giving and receiving feedback, and discuss facilitators and barriers. Data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method associated with a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: A total of 19 residents participated in 1 of 3 focus groups. Five major themes related to feedback were identified: teacher factors, learner factors, feedback process, feedback content, and educational context. Unapproachable attendings, time pressures due to clinical work, and discomfort with giving negative feedback were cited as major barriers in the feedback process. Learner engagement in the process was a major facilitator in the feedback process. CONCLUSIONS: Residents provided insights for improving the feedback process based on their dual roles as teachers and learners. Time pressures in the learning environment may be mitigated by efforts to improve the quality of teacher-learner relationships. Forms for collecting written feedback should be augmented by faculty development to ensure meaningful use. Efforts to improve residents' comfort with giving feedback and encouraging learners to engage in the feedback process may foster an environment conducive to increasing feedback.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reddy","given":"Shalini T"},{"family":"Zegarek","given":"Matthew H"},{"family":"Fromme","given":"H Barrett"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Michael S"},{"family":"Schumann","given":"Sarah-Anne"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Ilene B"}],"citation-key":"Reddy2015","container-title":"Journal of graduate medical education","DOI":"10.4300/JGME-D-14-00461.1","ISSN":"1949-8349","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"214-9","PMID":"26221437","title":"Barriers and Facilitators to Effective Feedback: A Qualitative Analysis of Data From Multispecialty Resident Focus Groups.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26221437","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Reed2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in medical education research quality are widely acknowledged. Content, internal structure, and criterion validity evidence support the use of the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) to measure education research quality, but predictive validity evidence has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To describe the quality of manuscripts submitted to the 2008 Journal of General Internal Medicine (JGIM) medical education issue and determine whether MERSQI scores predict editorial decisions. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of original, quantitative research studies submitted for publication. MEASUREMENTS: Study quality measured by MERSQI scores (possible range 5-18). RESULTS: Of 131 submitted manuscripts, 100 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) total MERSQI score was 9.6 (2.6), range 5-15.5. Most studies used single-group cross-sectional (54%) or pre-post designs (32%), were conducted at one institution (78%), and reported satisfaction or opinion outcomes (56%). Few (36%) reported validity evidence for evaluation instruments. A one-point increase in MERSQI score was associated with editorial decisions to send manuscripts for peer review versus reject without review (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.07-1.61, p = 0.009) and to invite revisions after review versus reject after review (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.05-1.58, p = 0.02). MERSQI scores predicted final acceptance versus rejection (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.58, p = 0.003). The mean total MERSQI score of accepted manuscripts was significantly higher than rejected manuscripts (10.7 [2.5] versus 9.0 [2.4], p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: MERSQI scores predicted editorial decisions and identified areas of methodological strengths and weaknesses in submitted manuscripts. Researchers, reviewers, and editors might use this instrument as a measure of methodological quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Darcy A."},{"family":"Beckman","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Scott M."},{"family":"Levine","given":"Rachel B."},{"family":"Kern","given":"David E."},{"family":"Cook","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"Reed2008","container-title":"Journal of General Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1007/s11606-008-0664-3","ISBN":"0884-8734","ISSN":"08848734","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,10]]},"page":"903-907","PMID":"18612715","title":"Predictive validity evidence for medical education research study quality instrument scores: Quality of submissions to JGIM's medical education special issue","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11606-008-0664-3","volume":"23"},

This study examined factors that may contribute to a medical student's decision to consider rural family medicine practice using the Community Apgar Questionnaire (CAQ). METHODS Third- and fourth-year medical students from 10 medical schools responded to a survey of 62 identified factors deemed to be present when assessing the strengths and challenges of recruiting family physicians to rural communities. Participants could also respond to six demographic questions. Factors were ranked based on importance to respondents and were compared using demographic information. RESULTS A total of 282 MS-3 and MS-4 students interested in family medicine from 10 US medical schools completed the survey (response rate 19.5%). Forty percent of participants anticipate practicing in a rural setting, followed by 31% for suburban and 29% for urban. The top three factors participants considered when anticipating a rural practice setting were spousal satisfaction, call frequency, and competition/collegiality. Additional differences were found across CAQ factors by future practice setting, gender, and location where the student was raised. CONCLUSIONS Medical schools, rural preceptors, and rural communities may wish to consider highly rated factors found in the CAQ in the effort to increase the recruitment of family physicians interested in rural practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Alex J"},{"family":"Schmitz","given":"David"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Girvan","given":"James"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Theodore"}],"citation-key":"Reed2017","container-title":"Family medicine","ISSN":"1938-3800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2]]},"page":"132-136","PMID":"28218939","title":"Assessment of Factors for Recruiting and Retaining Medical Students to Rural Communities Using the Community Apgar Questionnaire.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28218939","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"reis2008","abstract":"Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a process of developing non judgmental awareness of internal thoughts and feelings. MM is associated with improved cognition and affect in brain and behavior outcomes, but little is known regarding the nature or extent of these relationships. This dissertation is the first investigation into how MM may be related to both affect and cognitive control broadly, with the more narrow aim of characterizing the association between MM expertise (MME) and responses to specific types of affective provocations in behavior and brain outcomes. Three specific goals were to (1) determine if MME is associated with differences in relatively automatic processing of emotionally evocative stimuli, (2) examine whether MME predicts greater activity in brain regions supporting emotion and cognitive control in response to an affective provocation in a social context, and (3) assess whether MME is associated with distinct patterns of brain activity while viewing aversive images. In a between-groups, cross-sectional design, participants were expert meditators (1000 or more hours of practice, completion of at least 1 extended retreat, and regular practice at least 3 times per week) and control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. In study 1 (n = 36 meditators, 45 controls), I predicted and found that meditators showed better performance on an attentional blink task in which negatively valenced distractor images typically impair performance. In study 2 (n = 18 meditators, 12 controls), I predicted and found that MME was related to greater activity in the insula and anterior cingulate--brain regions that subserve emotion and cognitive control--during emotional provocation in a social decision-making task. Finally, in study 3 (n = 18 meditators, 12 controls) I predicted that meditators would show greater neural activation in regions associated with emotion regulation when viewing aversive images; however, this hypothesis was not supported. Results from these cross-sectional studies indicate that experience with MM is associated with distinct reactions to emotional provocations in attention and social decision-making tasks, and have implications for understanding the relationship between MM and emotion regulation.","author":[{"family":"Reis","given":"Deidre Lynn"}],"citation-key":"reis2008","ISBN":"978-0-549-65315-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"English","note":"Yale University.

  {"id":"Reynolds2008","abstract":"Cardiogenic shock (CS) occurs in ≈5% to 8% of patients hospitalized with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Recent research has suggested that the peripheral vasculature and neurohormonal and cytokine systems play a role in the pathogenesis and persistence of CS. Early revascularization for CS improves survival substantially. New mechanical approaches to treatment are available, and clinical trials are feasible even in this high-risk population. Most importantly, hospital survivors have an excellent chance for long-term survival with good quality of life. This review will outline the causes, pathophysiology, and treatment of CS with a focus on CS complicating myocardial infarction (MI.) The case will be made for viewing CS as a serious disorder with a high early death rate, but one that is treatable and that, if approached aggressively, can result in full recovery.\\n\\nCS is a state of end-organ hypoperfusion due to cardiac failure. The definition of CS includes hemodynamic parameters: persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 to 90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure 30 mm Hg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in cardiac index (<1.8 L · min−1 · m−2 without support or <2.0 to 2.2 L · min−1 · m−2 with support) and adequate or elevated filling pressure (eg, left ventricular [LV] end-diastolic pressure >18 mm Hg or right ventricular [RV] end-diastolic pressure >10 to 15 mm Hg). The diagnosis is usually made with the help of pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization; however, Doppler echocardiography may also be used to confirm elevation of LV filling pressures.1 Hypoperfusion may be manifest clinically by cool extremities, decreased urine output, and/or alteration in mental status.

In the present study, detailed clinical assessments and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were performed prospectively on 100 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. HR variability was inversely correlated with HR (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (r = -0.22, p = 0.025) and digoxin use (r = -0.29, p = 0.004), but not with left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease or other clinical, electrocardiographic or angiographic variables. All patients were followed for 1 year. Major clinical events after initial discharge occurred in 10 patients and included 6 deaths and 4 coronary bypass operations. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the only variable that correlated with the occurrence of a clinical event (p = 0.002). Decreased HR variability and ejection fraction were the best predictors of mortality (both p < 0.01), and the contribution of HR variability to mortality was independent of ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease and other variables. Furthermore, 11 patients with HR variability <50 ms had an 18-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with HR variability >50 ms (36 vs 2%, p = 0.001).

During a 5-year period of follow-up, 342 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed, of which the time of onset was available in 211 (62%). The placebo group showed a bimodal circadian variation in onset of myocardial infarction with a primary peak between 4:00 AM and 10:00 AM (p less than 0.001). In the aspirin group, however, this circadian variation was minimal (p = 0.16), due primarily to a marked reduction in the morning peak of infarction. Specifically, aspirin was associated with a 59.3% reduction in the incidence of infarction during the morning waking hours, compared with a 34.1% reduction for the remaining hours of the day. The greater reduction was observed during the 3-hour interval immediately after awakening, a period with a risk of infarction twice that of any other comparable time interval (p less than 0.001). Aspirin intake was associated with a mean reduction in the incidence of infarction of 44.8% over the entire 24-hour cycle. These data support the hypothesis that increased platelet aggregability in the morning and upon arising contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction and that aspirin reduces the risk of infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation during these critical periods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ridker","given":"P M"},{"family":"Manson","given":"J E"},{"family":"Buring","given":"J E"},{"family":"Muller","given":"J E"},{"family":"Hennekens","given":"C H"}],"citation-key":"Ridker1990","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.82.3.897","ISBN":"0009-7322 (Print)\\r0009-7322 (Linking)","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",9,1]]},"page":"897-902","PMID":"2203556","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","title":"Circadian variation of acute myocardial infarction and the effect of low-dose aspirin in a randomized trial of physicians","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2203556","volume":"82"},
  {"id":"Ridker2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing inflammation without affecting lipid levels may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Yet, the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis has remained unproved. METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, involving 10,061 patients with previous myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter. The trial compared three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3 months) with placebo. The primary efficacy end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS At 48 months, the median reduction from baseline in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 26 percentage points greater in the group that received the 50-mg dose of canakinumab, 37 percentage points greater in the 150-mg group, and 41 percentage points greater in the 300-mg group than in the placebo group. Canakinumab did not reduce lipid levels from baseline. At a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the incidence rate for the primary end point was 4.50 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group, 4.11 events per 100 person-years in the 50-mg group, 3.86 events per 100 person-years in the 150-mg group, and 3.90 events per 100 person-years in the 300-mg group. The hazard ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the 50-mg group, 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.07; P=0.30); in the 150-mg group, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.021); and in the 300-mg group, 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P=0.031). The 150-mg dose, but not the other doses, met the prespecified multiplicity-adjusted threshold for statistical significance for the primary end point and the secondary end point that additionally included hospitalization for unstable angina that led to urgent revascularization (hazard ratio vs. placebo, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.95; P=0.005). Canakinumab was associated with a higher incidence of fatal infection than was placebo. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio for all canakinumab doses vs. placebo, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.06; P=0.31). CONCLUSIONS Antiinflammatory therapy targeting the interleukin-1β innate immunity pathway with canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo, independent of lipid-level lowering.

Spectral analysis of simultaneous R-R and AP variabilities quantified these oscillations that were also evaluated in units normalized by total power to focus on the balance of these two major components. At rest we observed a prevalent HF component (approximately 0.25 Hz) in R-R and AP variabilities that was synchronous with respiration. This HF component of R-R variability disappeared after atropine infusion and can be considered a marker mostly of vagal activity. When baroreceptor unloading, obtained by moderate hypotension, increased sympathetic activity the LF component increased in R-R, systolic, and diastolic AP variabilities. This increase in LF was not present after ganglionic blockade or after chronic arterial baroreceptor denervation. After chronic bilateral stellectomy, hypotension was not accompanied by an increase in LF component of R-R variability, while LF component remained in AP variability. An increase in LF component of R-R and AP variabilities was observed during transient coronary artery occlusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Rimoldi","given":"O"},{"family":"Pierini","given":"S"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"A"},{"family":"Cerutti","given":"S"},{"family":"Pagani","given":"M"},{"family":"Malliani","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Rimoldi1990","container-title":"The American journal of physiology","DOI":"10.1152/ajpheart.1990.258.4.H967","ISBN":"0002-9513 (Print)\\r0002-9513 (Linking)","ISSN":"0002-9513","issue":"4 Pt 2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",4]]},"page":"H967-76","PMID":"2109943","title":"Analysis of short-term oscillations of R-R and arterial pressure in conscious dogs.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2109943","volume":"258"},

This paper compares the prognostic value for survival without early elective surgery of eight different indices of the extent of coronary artery disease: the number of diseased vessels, two indices using the number of proximal arterial segments diseased, two empirically generated indices from the CASS data, and the published indices of Friesinger, Gensini, and the National Heart and Chest Hospital, London. All had considerable prognostic information. Typically 80% of the prognostic information in one index was also contained in another. Our analysis shows that good prediction from angiographic data results from a combination of left ventricular function and arteriographic extent of disease. Prognosis may reasonably be obtained from three simple indices: the number of vessels diseased, the number of proximal arterial segments diseased, and a left ventricular wall motion score. These three indices account for an estimated 84% of the prognostic information available. 6-yr survival varies between 93 and 16% depending upon the values of these three indices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ringqvist","given":"I."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"L.

  {"id":"Ritchie2012","abstract":"Objectives: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that 2 common polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region that have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) contribute to the variable penetrance of familial AF. Background: Although mutations in ion channels, gap junction proteins, and signaling molecules have been described for Mendelian forms of AF, penetrance is highly variable. Recent studies have consistently identified 2 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the chromosome 4q25 region as independent AF susceptibility alleles. Methods: Eleven families in which AF was present in <2 members who also shared a candidate gene mutation were studied. These mutations were identified in all subjects with familial lone AF (n = 33) as well as apparently unaffected family members (age >50 years with no AF; n = 17). Results: Mutations were identified in SCN5A (n = 6), NPPA (n = 2), KCNQ1 (n = 1), KCNA5 (n = 1), and NKX2.5 (n = 1). In genetic association analyses, unstratified and stratified according to age of onset of AF and unaffected age >50 years, there was a highly statistically significant association between the presence of both common (rs2200733 and rs10033464) and rare variants and AF (unstratified p = 1 × 10-8, stratified [age of onset <50 years and unaffected age >50 years] p = 7.6 × 10-5) (unstratified p < 0.0001, stratified [age of onset <50 years and unaffected age >50 years] p < 0.0001). Genetic association analyses showed that the presence of common 4q25 risk alleles predicted whether carriers of rare mutations developed AF (p = 2.2 × 10-4). Conclusions: Common AF-associated 4q25 polymorphisms modify the clinical expression of latent cardiac ion channel and signaling molecule gene mutations associated with familial AF.

  {"id":"Roberts2014a","abstract":"Role of a 4q25 Genetic Variant in Atrial Flutter Background The prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) following catheter ablation of atrial flutter (Afl) would be helpful to facilitate targeted arrhythmia monitoring and anti-coagulation strategies. A single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2200733, is strongly associated with AF. We sought to characterize the association between rs2200733 and prevalent Afl and to determine if the variant could predict AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Methods and Results We performed a genetic association study of 295 patients with Afl and/or AF and 469 controls using multivariable logistic regression. The variant was then assessed as a predictor of incident AF after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in 87 consecutive typical Afl patients with Cox proportional hazards models. The rs2200733 rare allele was associated with an adjusted 2.06-fold increased odds of isolated Afl (95% CI: 1.13-3.76, P = 0.019) and an adjusted 2.79-fold increased odds of a combined phenotype of AF and Afl (95% CI: 1.81-4.28, P < 0.001). Following catheter ablation for Afl, carrier status of rs2200733 failed to predict an increased risk of AF either among all subjects (adjusted HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.58-1.53, P = 0.806) or among those with isolated Afl (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.51-3.26, P = 0.585). Conclusions Our study demonstrates that Afl, whether occurring in isolation or along with AF, is associated with the rs2200733 AF risk allele.

This difference may be due, at least in part, to genetic factors.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine whether 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AF account for this paradoxical differential racial risk for AF and to use admixture mapping to search genome-wide for loci that may account for this phenomenon.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Genome-wide admixture analysis and candidate SNP study involving 3 population-based cohort studies that were initiated between 1987 and 1997, including the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (n = 4173), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) (n = 12 341) study, and the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) (n = 1015) study. In all 3 studies, race was self-identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models and the proportion of treatment effect method were used to determine the impact of 9 AF-risk SNPs among participants from CHS and the ARIC study. The present study began July 1, 2012, and was completed in 2015.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident AF systematically ascertained using clinic visit electrocardiograms, hospital discharge diagnosis codes, death certificates, and Medicare claims data.\nRESULTS: A single SNP, rs10824026 (chromosome 10: position 73661450), was found to significantly mediate the higher risk for AF in white participants compared with black participants in CHS (11.4%; 95% CI, 2.9%-29.9%) and ARIC (31.7%; 95% CI, 16.0%-53.0%). Admixture mapping was performed in a meta-analysis of black participants within CHS (n = 811), ARIC (n = 3112), and Health ABC (n = 1015). No loci that reached the prespecified statistical threshold for genome-wide significance were identified.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The rs10824026 SNP on chromosome 10q22 mediates a modest proportion of the increased risk of AF among white individuals compared with black individuals, potentially through an effect on gene expression levels of MYOZ1.

  {"id":"Rodriguez-Segade2017","abstract":"Aims There is increasing interest in using fructosamine measurements in screening for or managing diabetes, yet uncertainty remains as to whether these measurements should be corrected for variation in serum protein concentrations. Methods We considered all sets of simultaneous measurements of fructosamine, albumin, total serum protein (TP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1C recorded in our laboratory over 10 years. The relationships between fructosamine and other variables were studied by multivariate linear regression and other analyses, and receiver operating curves (ROCs) were analysed to compare the diabetes screening performance of uncorrected fructosamine to those of albumin-corrected fructosamine (FAAlb) and TP-corrected fructosamine (FATP). Results 40,938 sets of measurements were collected from 20,114 patients. Though correlation between fructosamine and serum proteins was strongest among patients with HbA1C < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), it was also significant in the whole sample (r = 0.193 for albumin, r = 0.213 for TP). With diabetes defined by HbA1C ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), the areas under the ROCs of FAAlb (0.905) and FATP (0.895) were both significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that of uncorrected fructosamine (0.878). Correction of fructosamine for albumin or TP slightly improved its correlation with HbA1C. There was no correlation of protein (albumin or TP) with log(fructosamine/protein).

  {"id":"Rodriguez2015","abstract":"PURPOSE We studied incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in the prospective community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Reportedly, non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) have a lower AF burden compared with their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. Information on the epidemiology of AF in Hispanic and Asian populations is much more limited. METHODS We excluded participants with a history of AF at enrollment. A total of 6721 MESA participants were monitored for the first AF event ascertained according to hospital discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of AF were calculated per 1000 person-years of observation. IR ratios were calculated using NHWs as the reference group. Age- and sex-adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) of established modifiable AF risk factors were ascertained. RESULTS In the MESA cohort, 47.2% was male; at baseline, 25.7% had hypertension; 12.5% had diabetes. Three hundred five incident hospitalized AF events occurred over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years. Age- and sex-adjusted IRs and IR ratios showed that overall AF incidence was significantly lower among Hispanics, NHBs and Chinese compared with NHWs (all P < .001). Among participants 65 years of age or greater, Hispanics, Chinese, and blacks had significantly lower AF incidence than NHWs (all P ≤ .01), but IRs were similar among participants under age 65 years. The PAF for smoking was 27% among NHBs but lower among other race-ethnic groups. Among NHWs, the PAF for hypertension was 22.2%, but this was higher among NHBs (33.1%), Chinese (46.3%), and Hispanics (43.9%). CONCLUSIONS Overall, the incidence of hospitalized AF was significantly lower in Hispanics, NHBs, and Chinese than in NHWs. A larger proportion of AF events appear to be attributable to hypertension among nonwhite populations compared with NHWs.","author":[{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Carlos J"},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Swett","given":"Katrina"},{"family":"Okin","given":"Peter M"},{"family":"Goff","given":"David C"},{"family":"Heckbert","given":"Susan R"}],"citation-key":"Rodriguez2015","container-title":"Annals of epidemiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.11.024","ISSN":"1873-2585","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"page":"71-6, 76.e1","PMID":"25523897","title":"Atrial fibrillation incidence and risk factors in relation to race-ethnicity and the population attributable fraction of atrial fibrillation risk factors: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"Rosano2017","abstract":"Background Patients with microvascular angina (exertional angina, positive exercise tests and normal coronary arteriograms) usually have a reduced coronary blood flow reserve. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor involved in modulation of coronary vasomotor tone and may play a role in microvascular angina. Methods We compared the effects of NPY (0.2–1.0 pmol/kg, intracoronary) on the vasomotor response of proximal and distal segments of the coronary arteries in 7 patients with microvascular angina, 9 with chronic stable angina, and 9 control individuals. The coronary response to the administration of ergonovine was also assessed in 9 other patients with microvascular angina. Computerized coronary artery diameter measurements were carried out before (baseline) and after the administration of the vasoactive agents. Results Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8 ± 2%, 5 ± 2% and 6 ± 3% and distal segments by 14 ± 2%, 11 ± 2% and 10 ± 2% in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p = NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7 ± 1.5% and distal segments by 12.5 ± 3% (p = NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient. Conclusions Exogenous NPY causes mild epicardial coronary artery constriction which is similar in patients with non-cardiac chest pain, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia and marked lengthening of the contrast run off in response to NPY occurred in microvascular angina patients but not in control or coronary artery disease patients. An abnormal constrictor response to NPY at the microcirculation level could be the mechanism underlying the ischemic manifestations observed in patients with microvascular angina. Condensed abstract (table of contents) The vasomotor response of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was studied in twenty five patients: 7 microvascular angina, 9 chronic stable angina, and 9 control subjects. Computerized measurements of coronary diameters were carried out before and after the intracoronary administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ergonovine. Constriction of epicardial arteries in response to NPY was mild and not significantly different in control, microvascular angina and coronary artery disease patients. Ergonovine-induced epicardial coronary artery constriction was similar to that of NPY. However, NPY caused transient myocardial ischemia in patients with microvascular angina (probably through constriction of the small intramyocardial vessels), but not in control subjects or coronary artery disease patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosano","given":"Giuseppe M.C."},{"family":"Tousoulis","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"McFadden","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"John"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Graham J"},{"family":"Kaski","given":"Juan Carlos"}],"citation-key":"Rosano2017","container-title":"International Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.024","ISSN":"18741754","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"123-127","title":"Effects of neuropeptide Y on coronary artery vasomotion in patients with microvascular angina","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2017.03.0240167-5273/","volume":"238"},

  {"id":"Rose1986","abstract":"Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are among the most common electrolyte disorders. Since the plasma sodium level is determined by the ratio between the total quantity of effective solutes (primarily sodium and potassium salts) and the total body water, abnormalities in the plasma sodium level must be produced by a change in one or more of these parameters. In most patients, alterations in body water are of primary importance because the plasma sodium level is normally regulated by changing water intake and water excretion. Measurement of free water excretion has traditionally been calculated by using a formula that includes the urine osmolality. However, urea is a major urinary solute but does not contribute to regulation of the plasma sodium level, since it is an ineffective osmole. As a result, urinary solute excretion is best expressed as 2 × UNa+K. Making this important correction allows solute and water intake and excretion to be compared, thereby leading to a better understanding of both the development and correction of disturbances in the plasma sodium level. © 1986.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rose","given":"Burton D"}],"citation-key":"Rose1986","container-title":"The American Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/0002-9343(86)90401-8","ISSN":"00029343","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]},"page":"1033-1040","PMID":"3799631","title":"New approach to disturbances in the plasma sodium concentration","type":"article-journal","volume":"81"},
  {"id":"Roselli2018","abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects more than 33 million individuals worldwide1 and has a complex heritability2. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AF to date, consisting of more than half a million individuals, including 65,446 with AF. In total, we identified 97 loci significantly associated with AF, including 67 that were novel in a combined-ancestry analysis, and 3 that were novel in a European-specific analysis. We sought to identify AF-associated genes at the GWAS loci by performing RNA-sequencing and expression quantitative trait locus analyses in 101 left atrial samples, the most relevant tissue for AF. We also performed transcriptome-wide analyses that identified 57 AF-associated genes, 42 of which overlap with GWAS loci. The identified loci implicate genes enriched within cardiac developmental, electrophysiological, contractile and structural pathways. These results extend our understanding of the biological pathways underlying AF and may facilitate the development of therapeutics for AF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Roselli","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Chaffin","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Weng","given":"Lu-Chen"},{"family":"Aeschbacher","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Ahlberg","given":"Gustav"},{"family":"Albert","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Almgren","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Aragam","given":"Krishna G."},{"family":"Arking","given":"Dan E."},{"family":"Barnard","given":"John"},{"family":"Bartz","given":"Traci M."},{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Emelia J."},{"family":"Bihlmeyer","given":"Nathan A."},{"family":"Bis","given":"Joshua C."},{"family":"Bloom","given":"Heather L."},{"family":"Boerwinkle","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Bottinger","given":"Erwin B."},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Calkins","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Archie"},{"family":"Cappola","given":"Thomas P."},{"family":"Carlquist","given":"John"},{"family":"Chasman","given":"Daniel I."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lin Y."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yii-Der Ida"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Eue-Keun"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Seung Hoan"},{"family":"Christophersen","given":"Ingrid E."},{"family":"Chung","given":"Mina K."},{"family":"Cole","given":"John W."},{"family":"Conen","given":"David"},{"family":"Cook","given":"James"},{"family":"Crijns","given":"Harry J."},{"family":"Cutler","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Damrauer","given":"Scott M."},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Brian R."},{"family":"Darbar","given":"Dawood"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Graciela"},{"family":"Denny","given":"Joshua C."},{"family":"Dichgans","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Dörr","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Dudink","given":"Elton A."},{"family":"Dudley","given":"Samuel C."},{"family":"Esa","given":"Nada"},{"family":"Esko","given":"Tonu"},{"family":"Eskola","given":"Markku"},{"family":"Fatkin","given":"Diane"},{"family":"Felix","given":"Stephan B."},{"family":"Ford","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Oscar H."},{"family":"Geelhoed","given":"Bastiaan"},{"family":"Grewal","given":"Raji P."},{"family":"Gudnason","given":"Vilmundur"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiuqing"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Namrata"},{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Gutmann","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Hamsten","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Tamara B."},{"family":"Hayward","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Heckbert","given":"Susan R."},{"family":"Hernesniemi","given":"Jussi"},{"family":"Hocking","given":"Lynne J."},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Albert"},{"family":"Horimoto","given":"Andrea R.

  {"id":"Rowe2008","abstract":"Sleep is a crucial biological process that is regulated through complex interactions between multiple brain regions and neuromodulators. As sleep disorders can have deleterious impacts on health and quality of life, a wide variety of pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat conditions of excessive wakefulness and excessive sleepiness. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), through its involvement in the ascending arousal system, impacts the efficacy of many wake- and sleep-promoting medications. Wake-promoting drugs such as amphetamine and modafinil increase extracellular levels of NE, enhancing transmission along the wake-promoting pathway. GABAergic sleep-promoting medications like benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs that act more specifically on benzodiazepine receptors increase the activity of GABA, which inhibits NE transmission and the wake-promoting pathway. Melatonin and related compounds increase sleep by suppressing the activity of the neurons in the brain's circadian clock, and NE influences the synthesis of melatonin. Antihistamines block the wake-promoting effects of histamine, which shares reciprocal signaling with NE. Many antidepressants that affect the signaling of NE are also used for treatment of insomnia. Finally, adrenergic receptor antagonists that are used to treat cardiovascular disorders have considerable sedative effects. Therefore, NE, long known for its role in maintaining general arousal, is also a crucial player in sleep pharmacology. The purpose of this review is to consider the role of NE in the actions of wake- and sleep-promoting drugs within the framework of the brain arousal systems. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"Rowin2017","abstract":"Background\nA previously under-recognized subset of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysms is being identified with increasing frequency. However, risks associated with this subgroup are unknown.\nObjectives\nThe authors aimed to clarify clinical course and prognosis of a large cohort of HCM patients with LV apical aneurysms over long-term follow-up.\nMethods\nThe authors retrospectively analyzed 1,940 consecutive HCM patients at 2 centers, 93 of which (4.8%) were identified with LV apical aneurysms; mean age was 56 ± 13 years, and 69% were male.\nResults\nOver 4.4 ± 3.2 years, 3 of the 93 patients with LV apical aneurysms (3%) died suddenly or of heart failure, but 22 (24%) survived with contemporary treatment interventions: 18 experienced appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharges, 2 underwent heart transplants, and 2 were resuscitated after cardiac arrest. The sudden death (SD) event rate was 4.7%/year, which includes sudden death, successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest or appropriate ICD interventions triggered by VF or rapid VT. Notably, recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring ≥2 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks occurred in 13 patients, including 6 who underwent successful radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmic focus without ventricular tachycardia recurrence. Five non-anticoagulated patients experienced nonfatal thromboembolic events (1.1%/year), whereas 13 with apical clots and anticoagulation did not incur embolic events. There was no consistent relationship between aneurysm size and adverse HCM-related events. Rate of HCM-related deaths combined with life-saving aborted disease-related events was 6.4%/year, 3-fold greater than the 2.0%/year event rate in 1,847 HCM patients without aneurysms (p < 0.001).\nConclusions\nHCM patients with LV apical aneurysms are at high risk for arrhythmic sudden death and thromboembolic events.

  {"id":"Roy2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is common practice to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. This approach is based in part on data indicating that atrial fibrillation is a predictor of death in patients with heart failure and suggesting that the suppression of atrial fibrillation may favorably affect the outcome. However, the benefits and risks of this approach have not been adequately studied. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the maintenance of sinus rhythm (rhythm control) with control of the ventricular rate (rate control) in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was the time to death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: A total of 1376 patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm-control group and 694 in the rate-control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. Of these patients, 182 (27%) in the rhythm-control group died from cardiovascular causes, as compared with 175 (25%) in the rate-control group (hazard ratio in the rhythm-control group, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.30; P = 0.59 by the log-rank test). Secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups, including death from any cause (32% in the rhythm-control group and 33% in the rate-control group), stroke (3% and 4%, respectively), worsening heart failure (28% and 31%), and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or worsening heart failure (43% and 46%). There were also no significant differences favoring either strategy in any predefined subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a routine strategy of rhythm control does not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate-control strategy.

  {"id":"Rubart2005","abstract":"Worldwide, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major problem. It is most frequently caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias: Monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsade de pointes (TdP), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Beta blockade, ACE inhibition, coronary reperfusion and other treatments have reduced the incidence of VT but pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is increasingly seen, particularly in patients with advanced chronic heart disease. From existing data, bradyarrhythmia in the form of asystole (usually complete heart block without escape rhythm) causes only a minor proportion (10-15%) of SCD. In patients aged 50 years and more, coronary artery disease plays a dominant role causing more than 75% of SCD cases, either by acute ischemia and ventricular fibrillation or by chronic scar formation and reentrant VT. In younger patients, SCD may occur in patients with structurally normal hearts. A number of arrhythmogenic disorders with an increased risk of SCD have been detected and better understood recently, such as long and short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and the early repolarization syndrome. Most importantly, ECG signs and clinical features indicating high risk for SCD have been identified. Knowledge of the exact electrophysiologic mechanisms of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at the cellular level has been improved and mechanisms such as phase 2 reentry and reflection proposed to better understand why and how SCD occurs. © 2014, Cardiological Society of India.

Methods: This 10-week, acute, randomized, controlled, masked trial compared adjunctive VNS with sham treatment in 235 outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (n = 210) or nonpsychotic, depressed phase, bipolar disorder (n = 25). In the current episode, participants had not responded adequately to between two and six research-qualified medication trials. A two-week, single-blind recovery period (no stimulation) and then 10 weeks of masked active or sham VNS followed implantation. Medications were kept stable. Primary efficacy outcome among 222 evaluable participants was based on response rates (<50% reduction from baseline on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD 24]).

  {"id":"Russo2016","abstract":"Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with cardiac fibrosis that may reduce myocardial compliance, contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure, and trigger arrhythmic events. Diabetes-associated fibrosis is mediated by activated cardiac fibroblasts, but may also involve fibrogenic actions of macrophages, cardiomyocytes and vascular cells. The molecular basis responsible for cardiac fibrosis in diabetes remains poorly understood. Hyperglycemia directly activates a fibrogenic program, leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that crosslink extracellular matrix proteins, and transduce fibrogenic signals through reactive oxygen species generation, or through activation of Receptor for AGEs (RAGE)-mediated pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may recruit fibrogenic leukocyte subsets in the cardiac interstitium. Activation of transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling may activate fibroblasts inducing deposition of structural extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular macromolecules. Adipokines, endothelin-1 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have also been implicated in the diabetic myocardium. This manuscript reviews our current understanding of the cellular effectors and molecular pathways that mediate fibrosis in diabetes. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanism, we propose therapeutic interventions that may attenuate the diabetes-associated fibrotic response and discuss the challenges that may hamper clinical translation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Russo","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Frangogiannis","given":"Nikolaos G"}],"citation-key":"Russo2016","container-title":"Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.12.011","ISSN":"10958584","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"84-93","title":"Diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis: Cellular effectors, molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities","type":"article-journal","volume":"90"},

Patients with unrepaired lesions, cyanotic lesions, diminished systemic ventricular function, complex congenital heart disease, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, pulmonary hypertension, or mechanical valves are at highest risk of developing complications during pregnancy.

  {"id":"sacha2014","abstract":"Heart rate variability (HRV) is significantly associated with average heart rate (HR), therefore, HRV actually provides information on two quantities, that is, on HR and its variability. It is difficult to conclude which of these two plays a principal role in the HRV clinical value, or in other words, what is the HR contribution to the clinical significance of HRV. Moreover, the association between HRV and HR is both a physiological phenomenon and a mathematical one. The physiological HRV dependence on HR is determined by the autonomic nervous system activity, but the mathematical one is caused by the nonlinear relationship between RR interval and HR. By employing modification methods of the HRV and HR relationship, it is possible to investigate the HR contribution to the HRV clinical value. Recent studies have shown that the removal of the HR impact on HRV makes HRV more predictive for noncardiac death, however, the enhancement of this impact causes HRV to be a better predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Thus, HR seems to constitute a cardiovascular factor of the HRV predictive ability. HR also influences the reproducibility of HRV, therefore, HR changes should be considered when one compares HRV measurements in a given patient. This review summarizes methodological aspects of investigations of the HRV and HR interaction as well as latest observations concerning its clinical utility.

  {"id":"Saclova2022","abstract":"Accurate automated detection of P waves in ECG allows to provide fast correct diagnosis of various cardiac arrhythmias and select suitable strategy for patients’ treatment. However, P waves detection is a still challenging task, especially in long-term ECGs with manifested cardiac pathologies. Software tools used in medical practice usually fail to detect P waves under pathological conditions. Most of recently published approaches have not been tested on such the signals at all. Here we introduce a novel method for accurate and reliable P wave detection, which is success in both normal and pathological cases. Our method uses phasor transform of ECG and innovative decision rules in order to improve P waves detection in pathological signals. The rules are based on a deep knowledge of heart manifestation during various arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contraction, etc. By involving the rules into the decision process, we are able to find the P wave in the correct location or, alternatively, not to search for it at all. In contrast to another studies, we use three, highly variable annotated ECG databases, which contain both normal and pathological records, to objectively validate our algorithm. The results for physiological records are Se = 98.56% and PP = 99.82% for MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDP, with MITDB P-Wave Annotations) and Se = 99.23% and PP = 99.12% for QT database. These results are comparable with other published methods. For pathological signals, the proposed method reaches Se = 96.40% and PP = 91.56% for MITDB and Se = 93.07% and PP = 88.60% for Brno University of Technology ECG Signal Database with Annotations of P wave (BUT PDB). In these signals, the proposed detector greatly outperforms other methods and, thus, represents a huge step towards effective use of fully automated ECG analysis in a real medical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Saclova","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Nemcova","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Smisek","given":"Radovan"},{"family":"Smital","given":"Lukas"},{"family":"Vitek","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Ronzhina","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"Saclova2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-10656-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,21]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"6589","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Reliable P wave detection in pathological ECG signals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10656-4","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Sager2017","abstract":"Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy. Most research has focused on lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients. A clinical utility for PCT has also been found for patients with urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, meningitis, and patients with acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e., pneumonia). In these indications, PCT levels measured on hospital admission were found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e., bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation). For more severe infections (i.e., pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring of PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment durations with early cessation of therapy. Importantly, these strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failures. PCT kinetics also proved to have prognostic value correlating with disease severity (i.e., pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e., sepsis). Although promising findings have been published in these different types of infections, there are a number of limitations regarding PCT, including suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, which makes a careful interpretation of PCT in the clinical context mandatory. This narrative review aims to update clinicians on the strengths and limitations of PCT for patient management, focusing on research conducted within the last 4 years.","author":[{"family":"Sager","given":"Ramon"},{"family":"Kutz","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Schuetz","given":"Philipp"}],"citation-key":"Sager2017","container-title":"BMC Medicine","DOI":"10.1186/s12916-017-0795-7","ISBN":"1755-5922","ISSN":"17417015","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-11","PMID":"28114931","publisher":"BMC Medicine","title":"Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0795-7","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"Sahn1978","abstract":"Four hundred M-mode echocardiographic surveys were distributed to determine interobserver variability in M-mode echocardiographic measurements. This was done with a view toward examining the need and determining the criteria for standardization of measurement. Each survey consisted of five M-mode echocardiograms with a calibration marker, measured by the survey participants anonymously. The echoes were judged of adequate quality for measurement of structures. Seventy-six of the 400 (19%) were returned, allowing comparison of interobserver variability as well as examination of the measurement criteria which were used. Mean measurements and percent uncertainty were derived for each structure for each criterion of measurement. For example, for the aorta, 33% of examiners measured the aorta as an outer/inner or leading edge dimension, and 20% measured it as an outer/outer dimension. The percent uncertainty for the measurement (1.97 SD divided by the mean) showed a mean of 13.8% for the 25 packets of five echoes measured using the former criteria and 24.2% using the latter criteria. For ventricular chamber and cavity measurements, almost one-half of the examiners used the peak of the QRS and one-half of the examiners used the onset of the QRS for determining end-diastole. Estimates of the percent of measurement uncertainty for the septum, posterior wall and left ventricular cavity dimension in this study were 10--25%. They were much higher (40--70%) for the right ventricular cavity and right ventricular anterior wall. The survey shows significant interobserver and interlaboratory variation in measurement when examining the same echoes and indicates a need for ongoing education, quality control and standardization of measurement criteria. Recommendations for new criteria for measurement of M-mode echocardiograms are offered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sahn","given":"D J"},{"family":"DeMaria","given":"A"},{"family":"Kisslo","given":"J"},{"family":"Weyman","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Sahn1978","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.58.6.1072","ISBN":"0009-7322 (Print)","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978",12,6]]},"page":"1072-1083","PMID":"709763","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","title":"Recommendations regarding quantitation in M-mode echocardiography: Results of a survey of echocardiographic measurements","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/709763","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"Sakao2014","abstract":"The loss of pulmonary vessels has been shown to be related to the severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The severity of hypoxaemia is also related to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular resistance in these patients, suggesting that the hypoxic condition probably plays an important role in this form of pulmonary hypertension. However, pulmonary hypertension also develops in patients with mild COPD without hypoxaemia. Oxygen supplementation therapy often fails to reverse the pulmonary hypertension in these COPD patients, thus suggesting that the pulmonary vascular alterations in those patients may involve different sites of the pulmonary vasculature or a different form of vascular remodelling. It has recently been demonstrated that pulmonary vascular remodelling, resulting in pulmonary hypertension in COPD patients, can develop independently from parenchymal destruction and loss of lung vessels. We wonder whether the changes in the lung microenvironment due to hypoxia and vessel loss have a causative role in the development of pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD. Herein we review the pathobiological features of the pulmonary vasculature in COPD patients and suggest that pulmonary hypertension can occur with and without emphysematous lung tissue destruction and with and without loss of lung vessels.","author":[{"family":"Sakao","given":"Seiichiro"},{"family":"Voelkel","given":"Norbert F."},{"family":"Tatsumi","given":"Koichiro"}],"citation-key":"Sakao2014","container-title":"European Respiratory Review","DOI":"10.1183/09059180.00007913","ISSN":"16000617","issue":"133","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"350-355","PMID":"25176971","title":"The vascular bed in COPD: Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular alterations","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

Hypothesis: Neck fullness and witnessed neck pulsations have a high positive predictive value in the diagnosis of typical AVNRT. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with palpitations presenting to a single electrophysiology (EP) laboratory over a 1 year period. Each patient underwent a standard questionnaire regarding neck fullness and/or witnessed neck pulsations during their palpitations. The reference standard for diagnosis was determined by electrocardiogram and invasive EP studies. Results: Comparing typical AVNRT to atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) patients, the proportions with neck fullness and witnessed neck pulsations did not significantly differ: in the best case scenario (using the upper end of the 95%confidence interval (CI), none of the positive or negative predictive values exceeded 79%. After restricting the population to those with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) other than AF or AFL, neck fullness again exhibited poor test characteristics; however, witnessed neck pulsations exhibited a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 90%-100%) and a positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI: 52%-98%). After adjustment for potential confounders, SVT patients with witnessed neck pulsations had a seven-fold greater odds of having typical AVNRT, p = 0.029.

  {"id":"Sala2017","abstract":"Background: This study addresses whether a unitary cardiac autonomic nervous system index (ANSI), obtained combining multiple metrics from heart rate variability (HRV) into a radar plot could provide an easy appreciation of autonomic performance in a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: Data are standardized using percentile ranking of autonomic proxies from a relatively large reference population (n = 1593, age 39 ± 13 years). Autonomic indices are obtained from autoregressive spectral analysis of (ECG derived) HRV at rest and during standing up. A reduced ANSI (using RR, RR variance and rest–stand difference of LFnu) is then constructed as a radar plot, quantified according to its combined area and tested against different risk subgroups. Results: With growing risk profile, there is a marked reduction of the rank value of ANSI, quantified individually by the radar plot area. The practical usefulness of the approach was tested in small groups of additional subjects putatively characterized by elevated or poor autonomic performance. Data show that elite endurance athletes are characterized by elevated values of ANSI (80·6 ± 14·9, P < 0·001) while subjects with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes show lower values (DM1 = 37·0 ± 18·9 and DM2 = 26·8 ± 23·3, P = 0·002), and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) represent a nadir (17 ± 20, P < 0·001). Conclusions: This observational study shows the feasibility of testing simpler metrics of cardiac autonomic regulation based on a multivariate unitary index in a preventive setting. This simple approach might foster a wider application of HRV in the clinical arena, and permit an easier appreciation of autonomic performance.","author":[{"family":"Sala","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Malacarne","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Solaro","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Pagani","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Lucini","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"Sala2017","container-title":"European Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1111/eci.12730","ISSN":"13652362","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"241-249","title":"A composite autonomic index as unitary metric for heart rate variability: a proof of concept","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Short term analysis of HRV features has been investigated mostly in ECG data from normal and cardiac patients. Thus, short term HRV features may not have any relevance on the assessment of acute mental stress. In this study, we obtained ultra short term HRV features from 24 subjects during baseline stage and Stroop color word test.

The main goal of this study is to test the association between SNPs in CDH13 and CTNNA2 genes and ADHD across the life cycle in subjects with ADHD. This study included 1,136 unrelated ADHD cases and 946 individuals without ADHD. No significant association between CDH13 and CTNNA2 was observed between cases and controls across different samples (P ≥ 0.096 for all comparisons). No allele was significantly more transmitted than expected from parents to ADHD probands.

A wide range of platforms exist to model and study disorders associated with sudden cardiac death. Human clinical studies are cumbersome and are thwarted by the extent of investigation that can be performed on human subjects. Animal models are limited by their degree of homology to human cardiac electrophysiology, including ion channel expression. Most commonly used cellular models are cellular transfection models, which are able to mimic the expression of a single-ion channel offering incomplete insight into changes of the action potential profile. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes resemble, but are not identical, adult human cardiomyocytes and provide a new platform for studying arrhythmic disorders leading to sudden cardiac death. A variety of platforms exist to phenotype cellular models, including conventional and automated patch clamp, multielectrode array, and computational modeling. Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes have been used to study long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and other hereditary cardiac disorders.

Atrial and Pulmonary Vein (PV) muscle sleeve microstructural remodeling is present, and establishes a vulnerable substrate for AF maintenance. In spite of an incomplete understanding of the anatomo-functional basis for AF, current evidence demonstrates that this arrhythmia usually requires a trigger for initiation and a vulnerable electrophysiological and/or anatomical substrate for maintenance. It is still unclear whether the trigger mechanisms include focal enhanced automaticity, triggered activity and/or micro re-entry from myocardial tissue. Initiation of AF can be favored by both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation, which also seem to play a role in maintaining AF. Finally, evolving clinical evidence demonstrates that inflammation is associated with new-onset and recurrent AF through a mechanism that possibly involves cellular degeneration, apoptosis, and subsequent atrial fibrosis.","author":[{"family":"Sánchez-Quintana","given":"Damián"},{"family":"Ramón López-Mínguez","given":"José"},{"family":"Pizarro","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Murillo","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Cabrera","given":"José Angel"}],"citation-key":"SanchezQuintana2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"310-326","title":"Send Orders of Reprints at reprints@benthamscience.org Triggers and Anatomical Substrates in the Genesis and Perpetuation of Atrial Fibrillation","type":"report","volume":"8"},

In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future.

Current national data trends for the incidence, stroke risk profiles, and mortality of hospitalization for NVAF and atrial flutter (AFL) are sparse. Methods: The Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database was used to identify patients ≥ 20 years with incident NVAF/AFL (NVAF, ICD-9 code 427.3 or ICD-10 I48) in any diagnosis field from 2006 to 2015 in Canada, except Québec. National and provincial trends in rate over time (rate ratio, 95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for age-sex standardized hospitalizations. Trends in stroke risk profiles and in-hospital mortality rates adjusted for stroke risk factors were also calculated. Results: A total of 578,947 patients were hospitalized with incident NVAF/AFL. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range: 68-84), 82% were ≥ 65 years, 54% were men, 54% had a CHADS2 ≥ 2, and 69% had a CHA2DS2-Vasc ≥ 3. The overall age- and sex-standardized rate of NVAF/AFL hospitalization was 315 per 100,000 population and declined by 2% per year (P < 0.001). There was an annual rate decline in NVAF/AFL hospitalizations in every province. The majority of hospitalized patients are at high risk of stroke, and this risk remained unchanged. The average adjusted in-hospital mortality was 8.80 per 100 patients 95% CI, 8.80-8.81 with a 2% annual decline in rate (P < 0.001).

  {"id":"Sassi2015","abstract":"Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning.

  {"id":"Sauermann2017a","abstract":"Most scientific research is performed by teams, and for a long time, observers have inferred individual team members’ contributions by interpreting author order on published articles. In response to increasing concerns about this approach, journals are adopting policies that require the disclosure of individual authors’ contributions. However, it is not clear whether and how these disclosures improve upon the conventional approach. Moreover, there is little evidence on how contribution statements are written and how they are used by readers. We begin to address these questions in two studies. Guided by a conceptual model, Study 1 examines the relationship between author order and contribution statements on more than 12,000 articles to understand what information is provided by each. This analysis quantifies the risk of error when inferring contributions from author order and shows how this risk increases with team size and for certain types of authors. At the same time, the analysis suggests that some components of the value of contributions are reflected in author order but not in currently used contribution statements. Complementing the bibliometric analysis, Study 2 analyzes survey data from more than 6000 corresponding authors to examine how contribution statements are written and used. This analysis highlights important differences between fields and between senior versus junior scientists, as well as strongly diverging views about the benefits and limitations of contribution statements. On the basis of both studies, we highlight important avenues for future research and consider implications for a broad range of stakeholders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sauermann","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Haeussler","given":"Carolin"}],"citation-key":"Sauermann2017a","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.1700404","ISSN":"23752548","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"PMID":"29152564","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","title":"Authorship and contribution disclosures","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"sayeed2006","abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the effects of postinjury administration of allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, to progesterone in an animal model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in age-matched, adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats by using an intraluminal filament and suture method to occlude the right middle cerebral artery. After 120 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor cerebral blood flow for the entire 2-hour period of occlusion and for 5 minutes after reperfusion. Animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion received injections of allopregnanolone (8 mg/kg, n=6), progesterone (8 mg/kg, n=6) and vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, n=7) at 2 hours (intraperitoneally 5 minutes before reperfusion) and 6 hours (subcutaneously) postocclusion. Brains were removed at 72 hours post-middle cerebral artery occlusion, sectioned into coronal slices, and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). In a blinded analysis, infarct volume was calculated by using computer-aided morphometry to measure brain areas not stained with TTC. RESULTS: After progesterone or allopregnanolone treatment, stained sections revealed a significant reduction in cortical, caudate-putamen, and hemispheric infarct volumes (percentage of contralateral structure) compared with vehicle-injected controls. Cortical infarction (percentage of contralateral cortex) was 37.47%+/-10.57% (vehicle), 25.49%+/-7.38% (progesterone; P<.05 from vehicle), and 11.40%+/-7.09% (allopregnanolone; P<.05 from vehicle; P<.05 from progesterone). Caudate-putamen infarction (percentage of contralateral caudate-putamen) was 78.02%+/-22.81% (vehicle), 48.41%+/-22.44% (progesterone; P<.05 from vehicle), and 50.44%+/-10.90% (allopregnanolone; P<.05 from vehicle). Total hemispheric infarction (percentage of contralateral hemisphere) was 24.37%+/-6.69% (vehicle), 15.95%+/-3.59% (progesterone; P<.05 from vehicle), and 11.54%+/-3.71% (allopregnanolone; P<.05 from vehicle). No significant differences in cerebral blood flow between groups and time points during ischemia and early reperfusion were observed, suggesting that the relative ischemic insult was equivalent among all groups. CONCLUSION: Although progesterone and allopregnanolone are effective in reducing infarct pathology, allopregnanolone is more potent than progesterone in attenuating cortical damage. Our results suggest that both neurosteroids should be examined for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial for ischemic stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sayeed","given":"Iqbal"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Qingmin"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Stuart W"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Donald G"}],"citation-key":"sayeed2006","container-title":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","container-title-short":"Ann Emerg Med","DOI":"10.1016/j.annemergmed.2005.12.011","ISSN":"1097-6760","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",4]]},"page":"381-389","PMID":"16546625","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite, is more effective than progesterone in reducing cortical infarct volume after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/16546625","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"sayeed2009","abstract":"The search for a \"magic bullet\" drug targeting a single receptor for the treatment of stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) has failed thus far for a variety of reasons. The pathophysiology of ischemic brain injury and TBI involves a number of mechanisms leading to neuronal injury, including excitotoxicity, free radical damage, inflammation, necrosis, and apoptosis. Brain injury also triggers auto-protective mechanisms, including the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and endogenous antioxidants. In these conditions an agent with pleiotropic consequences is more likely to provide effective neuroprotection and repair than one operating primarily on a single, or a small number of, injury mechanisms. There is growing evidence, including recently published clinical trials, that progesterone and perhaps its metabolite allopregnanolone exert neuroprotective effects on the injured central nervous system (CNS). Laboratories around the world have shown that progesterone and allopregnanolone act through numerous metabolic and physiological pathways that can affect the injury response in many different tissues and organ systems. Furthermore, progesterone is a natural hormone, synthesized in both males and females, that can act as a pro-drug for other metabolites with their own distinct mode of action in CNS repair. These properties make progesterone a unique and compelling natural agent to consider for testing in clinical trial for CNS injuries including TBI and stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sayeed","given":"Iqbal"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Donald G"}],"citation-key":"sayeed2009","container-title":"Progress in Brain Research","container-title-short":"Prog.

  {"id":"Scheer2010","abstract":"The risk of adverse cardiovascular events peaks in the morning (≈9:00 AM) with a secondary peak in the evening (≈8:00 PM) and a trough at night. This pattern is generally believed to be caused by the day/night distribution of behavioral triggers, but it is unknown whether the endogenous circadian system contributes to these daily fluctuations. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the circadian system modulates autonomic, hemodynamic, and hemostatic risk markers at rest, and that behavioral stressors have different effects when they occur at different internal circadian phases. Twelve healthy adults were each studied in a 240-h forced desynchrony protocol in dim light while standardized rest and exercise periods were uniformly distributed across the circadian cycle. At rest, there were large circadian variations in plasma cortisol (peak-to-trough ≈85% of mean, peaking at a circadian phase corresponding to ≈9:00 AM) and in circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, ≈70%; norepinephrine, ≈35%, peaking during the biological day). At ≈8:00 PM, there was a circadian peak in blood pressure and a trough in cardiac vagal modulation. Sympathetic variables were consistently lowest and vagal markers highest during the biological night. We detected no simple circadian effect on hemostasis, although platelet aggregability had two peaks: at ≈noon and ≈11:00 PM. There was circadian modulation of the cardiovascular reactivity to exercise, with greatest vagal withdrawal at ≈9:00 AM and peaks in catecholamine reactivity at ≈9:00 AM and ≈9:00 PM. Thus, the circadian system modulates numerous cardiovascular risk markers at rest as well as their reactivity to exercise, with resultant profiles that could potentially contribute to the day/night pattern of adverse cardiovascular events.","author":[{"family":"Scheer","given":"F.

  {"id":"scherrer2019","abstract":"Background—Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Biopsychosocial factors associated with PTSD likely account for some or all of this association. We determined whether 1, or a combination of comorbid conditions explained the association between PTSD and incident CVD. Methods and Results—Eligible patients used 1 of 5 Veterans Health Affairs medical centers distributed across the United States. Data were obtained from electronic health records. At index date, 2519 Veterans Health Affairs (VA) patients, 30 to 70 years of age, had PTSD diagnoses and 1659 did not. Patients had no CVD diagnoses for 12 months before index date. Patients could enter the cohort between 2008 and 2012 with follow-up until 2015. Age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were computed before and after adjusting for comorbidities. Patients were middle aged (mean=50.1 years, SD±11.0), mostly male (87.0%), and 60% were white. The age-adjusted association between PTSD and incident CVD was significant (hazard ratio=1.41; 95% CI: 1.21–1.63). After adjustment for metabolic conditions, the association between PTSD and incident CVD was attenuated but remained significant (hazard ratio=1.23; 95% CI: 1.06–1.44). After additional adjustment for smoking, sleep disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression, PTSD was not associated with incident CVD (hazard ratio=0.96; 95% CI: 0.81–1.15). Conclusions—PTSD is not an independent risk factor for CVD. Physical and psychiatric conditions and smoking that co-occur with PTSD explain why this patient population has an increased risk of CVD. Careful monitoring may limit exposure to CVD risk factors and subsequent incident CVD.","author":[{"family":"Scherrer","given":"Jeffrey F."},{"family":"Salas","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Beth E."},{"family":"Schnurr","given":"Paula P."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"F.

The impact of these combined factors on the rheologic behavior of sickle cell suspensions and on guidelines for transfusion has not been explored fully. Therefore, the eta of mixtures of washed normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was determined in a rotational viscosimeter as a function of the hematocrit level of SS cells (HS), HT, oxygen tension (PO2), and shear rate. The ratio HT:eta can be taken as an index of potential oxygen delivery. The optimal HT (for maximum HT:eta) became progressively higher as the HS or the HS:HT ratio was lowered: at a given HT, HT:eta rose with a decrease in HS, especially at low HS values. These data support the concept that simple transfusion alone is not as beneficial to the patient as exchange transfusion and that substantial benefit can be obtained by bringing the patient to very low HS levels. The finding that eta rose with HT more steeply when the HS:HT ratio rather than HS was held constant suggested that the absolute level of HS may be more useful than the HS:HT ratio as a guide for a transfusion regimen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmalzer","given":"E.

However, little is known about the underlying myocardial blood flow response (MBF) in these patients. METHODS We investigated the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and myocardial blood flow responses to mental stress in 17 patients with CAD and 17 healthy volunteers of similar age. Mental stress was induced by asking individuals to solve mathematic subtractions in a progressively challenging sequence; MBF was quantified at rest and during mental stress using 13N ammonia PET. RESULTS Mental stress induced significant (P < 0.01) and comparable increases in rate-pressure product, measured in beats per minute x mm Hg, in both patients (from 7826 +/- 2006 to 10586 +/- 2800) and healthy volunteers (from 8227 +/- 1272 to 10618 +/- 2468).

Among 7099 individuals without hypertension at baseline, low heart rate variability predicted greater risk of incident hypertension over 9 years of follow-up. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval {[CI])} for the lowest compared with the highest quartile of the standard deviation of normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.24 (95% {CI,} 1.10–1.40), for the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal {R-R} intervals was 1.36 (95% {CI,} 1.21–1.54), and for {R-R} interval was 1.44 (95% {CI,} 1.27–1.63). Over 9 years, there was no measurable difference in the rate of change in heart rate variability among those with and without hypertension, although the differences in heart rate variability at follow-up were smaller than those at baseline. These findings thus support the thesis that the autonomic nervous system is involved in the development of hypertension, yet suggest that differences in the autonomic profile of hypertensives and normotensives do not increase with time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Emily B."},{"family":"Liao","given":"Duanping"},{"family":"Chambless","given":"Lloyd E."},{"family":"Prineas","given":"Ronald J."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Gregory W."},{"family":"Heiss","given":"Gerardo"}],"citation-key":"Schroeder2003","container-title":"Hypertension","DOI":"10.1161/01.HYP.0000100444.71069.73","ISSN":"0194-911X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",12,1]]},"page":"1106-1111","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","title":"Hypertension, Blood Pressure, and Heart Rate Variability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.0000100444.71069.73","volume":"42"},

Three 10-second and 2 six-minute heart rate recordings were obtained during each of 2 visits, separated by 1 to 2 weeks. We partitioned the measurement error into components and computed intraclass correlation coefficients using nested, random effects models.

Repeatability of measures from 10-second records was lower, but improved considerably when the mean from 2 or 3 records was used. Correlations between the same measures from different length recordings were quite high. Our findings support the use of records of at least 5 minutes in length in epidemiological studies, in accordance with previous guidelines.

  {"id":"Schutte2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND D-dimer is routinely measured as part of the clinical diagnosis algorithms for venous thromboembolism (VTE). In these algorithms, low D- dimer cut-off values are used to generate a dichotomous test result that is sensitive, but very non-specific for VTE. A consequence of any test dichotomisation is loss of information that is hidden in the continuous spectrum of results. For D-dimer, the information conveyed by extremely elevated results may be particularly relevant. Our aim was to assess the differential diagnosis of extremely elevated D-dimer levels in a hospital setting. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of patients > 18 years with an extremely elevated (> 5000 μg/l; > 10x cut-off to exclude VTE) D-dimer test result. Electronic medical records were reviewed for diagnoses. RESULTS A total of 759 extremely elevated D-dimer results were identified. After exclusion of 120 duplicate cases, 53 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 5 cases without diagnostic information, 581 cases were analysed. Their D-dimer ranged between 5030 and 239,000 μg/l, with a mean of 17,598 μg/l (SD 22,972 μg/l). Altogether, 89% of these patients had a diagnosis of VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. The prevalence was highest for pulmonary embolism (183 patients; 32%), followed by cancer (168 patients; 29%), sepsis (142 patients; 24%), trauma/surgery (142 patients; 24%), and deep vein thrombosis (73 patients; 13%). CONCLUSION Although D-dimer testing has a reputation for being very non-specific, an extremely elevated D-dimer is uniquely associated with severe disease, mainly including VTE, sepsis and/or cancer. These results suggest that, even if sharply elevated D-dimers are a seemingly solitary finding, clinical suspicion of severe underlying disease should be maintained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Schutte","given":"T"},{"family":"Thijs","given":"A"},{"family":"Smulders","given":"Y M"}],"citation-key":"Schutte2016","container-title":"Netherlands Journal of Medicine","ISSN":"03002977","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"443-448","PMID":"27966438","title":"Never ignore extremely elevated D-dimer levels: They are specific for serious illness","type":"article-journal","volume":"74"},

Experimental data show that left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD), in particular, is not only antiarrhythmic, but also antifibrillatory-an effect exquisitely important for any clinical condition associated with a high risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. LCSD has additional effects on both the coronary circulation and the mechanical performance of the left ventricle, with important implications for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Evidence also shows that LCSD increases the vagal activity directed to the heart, which has potential implications for the management of heart failure.

  {"id":"Schwartz2018","abstract":"Objective. In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the cervical spine, like other sections of the spine and sacroiliac joints, is vulnerable during the disease process. Atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS) has been studied in connection with AS, but its risk factors and progression have not been clarified. Therefore, this study assessed the prevalence and risk factors of AAS in patients with AS. Methods. A total of 819 patients with AS who fulfilled the modified New York criteria and were examined with a full-flexion lateral view of the cervical spine by radiograph were enrolled from an outpatient clinic. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed and the anterior atlantodental interval (AADI) in the lateral flexion view of the cervical spine radiograph was investigated by 2 experienced musculoskeletal radiologists. We defined the AAS as an AADI of > 3 mm, and progression of AADI as a progression rate > 0.5 mm/year. Results. AAS was found in 14.1% (116/819) of patients. Progression of AADI occurred in 32.1% (26/81) patients with AAS and 5.0% (16/320) patients without AAS (p < 0.001). The development of AAS was significantly associated with elevated C-reactive protein [CRP; OR 2.19 (1.36-3.53)], peripheral arthritis [OR 2.05 (1.36-3.07)], use of anti-tumor necrosis factor antagonists because of failure of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [NSAID/DMARD; OR 2.28 (1.52-3.42)], and uveitis [OR 1.71 (1.13-2.59)]. These factors were adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration by logistic regression analysis. No clear association was found for HLA-B27, seropositivity, or smoking status with AAS. Conclusion. AAS is a frequent complication, and the progression of AADI was more rapid in cases with AAS. The presence of peripheral arthritis, or high disease activity with elevated CRP level or refractory to conventional NSAID/DMARD, independently increased the risk of AAS, suggesting that clinicians should focus on the detection and monitoring of AAS, especially in cases with associated risk factors.

  {"id":"Schwartz2020","abstract":"The main inherited cardiac arrhythmias are long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and Brugada syndrome. These rare diseases are often the underlying cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals and result from mutations in several genes encoding ion channels or proteins involved in their regulation. The genetic defects lead to alterations in the ionic currents that determine the morphology and duration of the cardiac action potential, and individuals with these disorders often present with syncope or a life-threatening arrhythmic episode. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and history, the characteristics of the electrocardiographic recording at rest and during exercise and genetic analyses. Management relies on pharmacological therapy, mostly β-adrenergic receptor blockers (specifically, propranolol and nadolol) and sodium and transient outward current blockers (such as quinidine), or surgical interventions, including left cardiac sympathetic denervation and implantation of a cardioverter–defibrillator. All these arrhythmias are potentially life-threatening and have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of patients. Future research should focus on the identification of genes associated with the diseases and other risk factors, improved risk stratification and, in particular for Brugada syndrome, effective therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Ackerman","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Antzelevitch","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Bezzina","given":"Connie R."},{"family":"Borggrefe","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Cuneo","given":"Bettina F."},{"family":"Wilde","given":"Arthur A.

This article emphasizes the integration of the principles of mass balance and electroneutrality — which are prominently featured in the strong ion model (also known as the physicochemical model) — for interpretation of acid–base phenomena. Most acid–base abnormalities can be diagnosed and interpreted with the use of the traditional approach. Why, then, should the strong ion theory be in-corporated into teaching about acid–base balance? Although the Stewart model is not primarily a mathematical expression of a confirmed reality, it is relevant be-cause it is a powerful construct that can shed light on an important biologic system. Included in this article are several case vignettes that show the explanatory power of the strong ion approach in clinical practice. Some of these examples have been presented in a companion article on the physiological approach to acid–base balance by Berend et al. 7 Other cases that are interpreted with a strong ion ap-proach are included in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Our meta-analyses replicated the previously known locus for ADMA levels in DDAH1 (rs997251; P = 1.4 × 10(-40)), identified two non-synomyous polymorphisms for SDMA levels in AGXT2 (rs37369; P = 1.4 × 10(-40) and rs16899974; P = 1.5 × 10(-38)) and one in SLC25A45 (rs34400381; P = 2.5 × 10(-10)). We also fine-mapped the AGXT2 locus for further independent association signals. The two non-synonymous AGXT2 variants independently associated with SDMA levels were also significantly related with short-term heart rate variability (HRV) indices in young adults. The major allele (C) of the novel non-synonymous rs16899974 (V498L) variant associated with decreased SDMA levels and an increase in the ratio between the low- and high-frequency spectral components of HRV (P = 0.00047). Furthermore, the SDMA decreasing allele (G) of the non-synomyous SLC25A45 (R285C) variant was associated with a lower resting mean heart rate during the HRV measurements (P = 0.0046), but not with the HRV indices. None of the studied genome-wide significant variants had any major effect on cardiovascular or total mortality in patients referred for coronary angiography.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: AGXT2 has an important role in SDMA metabolism in humans.

  {"id":"Seward2010","abstract":"Infiltrative cardiomyopathies are characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances that cause the ventricular walls to become progressively rigid, thereby impeding ventricular filling. Some infiltrative cardiac diseases increase ventricular wall thickness, while others cause chamber enlargement with secondary wall thinning. Increased wall thickness, small ventricular volume, and occasional dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., amyloidosis) can outwardly appear similar to conditions with true myocyte hypertrophy (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease). Likewise, infiltrative disease that presents with a dilated left ventricle with global or regional wall motion abnormalities and aneurysm formation (e.g., sarcoidosis) may mimic ischemic cardiomyopathy. Low-voltage QRS complex was the sine qua non of infiltrative cardiomyopathy (i.e., cardiac amyloid). However, low-voltage QRS complex is not a uniform finding with the infiltrative cardiomyopathies. The clinical presentation, along with functional and morphologic features, often provides enough insight to establish a working diagnosis.

  {"id":"Sgoifo2015","abstract":"Depression occurs in people of all ages across all world regions; it is the second leading cause of disability and its global burden increased by 37.5% between 1990 and 2010. Autonomic changes are often found in altered mood states and appear to be a central biological substrate linking depression to a number of physical dysfunctions. Alterations of autonomic nervous system functioning that promotes vagal withdrawal are reflected in reductions of heart rate variability (HRV) indexes. Reduced HRV characterizes emotional dysregulation, decreased psychological flexibility and defective social engagement, which in turn are linked to prefrontal cortex hypoactivity. Altogether, these pieces of evidence support the idea that HRV might represent a useful endophenotype for psychological/physical comorbidities, and its routine application should be advised to assess the efficacy of prevention/intervention therapies in a number of psychosomatic and psychiatric dysfunctions. Further research, also making use of appropriate animal models, could provide a significant support to this point of view and possibly help to identify appropriate antidepressant therapies that do not interefere with physical health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sgoifo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Carnevali","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Pico Alfonso","given":"Maria de los Angeles"},{"family":"Amore","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"Sgoifo2015","container-title":"Stress","DOI":"10.3109/10253890.2015.1045868","ISBN":"1607-8888 (Electronic)\\r1025-3890 (Linking)","ISSN":"16078888","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5,4]]},"page":"343-352","PMID":"26004818","title":"Autonomic dysfunction and heart rate variability in depression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004818","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"Shaffer2017","abstract":"Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaffer","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Ginsberg","given":"J.

Methods: A total of 90 subjects underwent phonocardiography, echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, and left-sided heart catheterization. Results: Phonocardiography detected an S3in 21 patients (23%).

  {"id":"Shah2013","abstract":"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death. Methods: We measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs. Results: Of all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD. Conclusion: In middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Veledar","given":"Emir"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Shah2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Young women with coronary heart disease have high rates of depression and a higher risk of adverse events than men of similar age. Whether depression has a higher prognostic value in this group than in men and older women is not known. Our objective was to assess whether depression in young women is associated with higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse outcomes compared with similarly aged men and older women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 3237 patients undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and followed them for 2.9 years (median). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and CAD burden was dichotomized based on its presence or absence. After multivariable adjustment for CAD risk factors, depressive symptoms predicted CAD presence in women aged ≤ 55 years (odds ratio=1.07 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.13 per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years or women aged >55 years. Depressive symptoms also predicted increased risk of death in women aged ≤ 55 years (adjusted hazard ratio=1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14, per 1 point increase in PHQ-9 score), but not in men aged ≤ 55 years and women aged >55 years, with P=0.02 for the depression-sex interaction and P=0.02 for depression-sex-age interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected or established CAD, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of death, particularly in young women.

  {"id":"Shah2016a","abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Electrocardiography (ECG) may detect subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in asymptomatic individuals, but its role in assessing adverse events beyond traditional risk factors is not clear. Interval and vector data that are commonly available on modern ECGs may offer independent prognostic information that improves risk classification. OBJECTIVES: To derive and validate a CVD risk equation based on ECG metrics and to determine its incremental benefit in addition to the Framingham risk score (FRS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study included 3640 randomly selected community-based adults aged 40 to 74 years without known CVD from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) cohort (1971-1975) and 6329 from the NHANES III cohort (1988-1994). Participants were sampled from across the United States. A risk score to assess incident nonfatal and fatal CVD events was derived based on computer-generated ECG data, including frontal P, R, and T axes; heart rate; and PR, QRS, and QT intervals from NHANES I. The most prognostic variables, along with age and sex, were incorporated into the NHANES ECG risk equation. The equation was evaluated in the NHANES III cohort for an independent validation. Follow-up in the NHANES III cohort was completed on December 31, 2006. Data for this study were analyzed from August 11, 2015, to May 20, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was CVD death. Secondary outcomes included 10-year ischemic heart disease and all-cause death. RESULTS: The final study sample included 9969 participants (4714 men [47.3%]; 5255 women [52.7%]; mean [SD] age, 55.3 [10.1] years) from both cohorts. Frontal T axis, heart rate, and heart rate–corrected QT interval were the most significant ECG factors in the NHANES I cohort. In the validation cohort (NHANES III), the equation provided for prognostic information for fatal CVD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.23 (95% CI, 2.82-3.72); the C statistic was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81). When added to the FRS in Cox proportional hazards regression models, the categorical (1%, 5%, and 10% cutoffs) net reclassification improvement was 24%. When the FRS and ECG scores were combined in a single model, the C statistic improved by 0.04 (95% CI, 0.02-0.06) to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.82). Similar improvements were noted when the ECG score was added to the pooled cohort equation. When the equation for prognostic information about ischemic heart disease and all-cause death was evaluated, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An ECG risk score based on age, sex, heart rate, frontal T axis, and QT interval assesses the risk for CVD and compares favorably with the FRS alone in an independent cohort of asymptomatic individuals. Although the ECG risk equation is low cost, further research is needed to ascertain whether this additional step in risk stratification may improve prevention efforts and reduce CVD events.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Janssens","given":"A.

  {"id":"Shah2018","abstract":"Introduction: About one-half of sudden cardiac deaths occur in those without known CAD suggesting the need for better risk-stratification tests. Autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV), can occur with myocardial ischemia. Testing for low HRV may help to identify high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. The association of low HRV with ischemia may also be greatest during the morning hours, when cardiac events (MI, sudden death) are most likely to be triggered. Hypothesis: In a cohort of veteran males with no known CAD, subclinical myocardial ischemia is associated with autonomic dysfunction as measured by low HRV; this association is greatest during morning hours. Methods: We evaluated 24-hour ambulatory ECGs in middle-aged twins without known CAD from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry, and calculated frequency domain and non-linear (Dyx) HRV metrics. All subjects underwent [13N]-ammonia positron emission tomography with adenosine stress, with ischemia defined as greater than 5% perfusion deficit. Mixed models were used to compare HRV between ischemic and non-ischemic subjects in 1-hour intervals, and morning hours were 6 AM until 10 AM. Results: Data on 276 twin subjects were analyzed; the mean age (SD) was 53 (3) and 55 (20%) had ischemia. HRV was significantly different between ischemic and non-ischemic twins during morning hours (figure 1), with the largest magnitude difference occurring with Dyx at 7 AM. Each SD decrease in Dyx associated with an OR for ischemia of 4.8 (95% CI, 1.5 — 15.8). Dyx in morning hours remained significant in a subgroup of pairs discordant for ischemia and after risk factor adjustment. Significant differences by ischemia status were noted for low-frequency and very-low-frequency HRV. Conclusions: Lower HRV is strongly associated with subclinical myocardial ischemia primarily during morning hours. More research regarding this circadian autonomic vulnerability and its clinical implications are warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Anish S Amit Anish J"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Shah2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND Abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system may occur in ischemic heart disease, but the mechanisms by which they are linked are not fully defined. The risk of cardiac events is increased during morning hours. Studying the contributions of autonomic mechanisms may yield insights into risk stratification and treatment. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction, measured by decreased heart rate variability (HRV), associates with abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of the association between abnormal myocardial stress perfusion with HRV using 276 middle-aged veteran twins without known ischemic heart disease. The primary independent variable was cardiac autonomic regulation measured with 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, using linear and non-linear (multipole density, or Dyx) HRV metrics. The primary outcome was abnormal perfusion (>5% affected myocardium) during adenosine stress on [13N]-ammonia myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 53 (3) years and 55 (20%) had abnormal perfusion. HRV (by Dyx) was reduced during morning hours in subjects with abnormal perfusion. At 7 AM, each standard deviation (SD) decrease in Dyx was associated a 4.8 (95% CI, 1.5 - 15.8) odds ratio (OR) for abnormal MPI. With Dyx < 2.0, the 7 AM OR for abnormal MPI was 11.8 (95% CI, 1.2 - 111.4). CONCLUSIONS Autonomic dysfunction, measured by non-linear HRV in the morning hours, was associated with an increased OR of abnormal MPI. These results suggest a potentially important role of ECG-based biomarkers in risk stratification for individuals with suspected ischemic heart disease.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Anish S"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

Methods: We included ARIC cohort participants with information on psychosocial factors in 1990-1992 into our analysis.

Short-term time and frequency domain HRV were measured from a two-minute electrocardiographic recording in 1987-1989. Linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Results: We included 9,332 participants (mean age 54.4 ± 5.7 years, 55% women, and 25% black) in the analysis. Only vital exhaustion was consistently associated with HRV, as per the table, which shows the change in ln(HRV) per point increase in score. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of vital exhaustion was associated with a 13.3% (95% CI, 3.9% - 21.3%) decrease in low frequency HRV in adjusted models. By comparison, each year of added age was associated with a 3.7% (95% CI, 3.1% to 4.2%) decrease in LF HRV. Conclusion: A high level of vital exhaustion was associated with low HRV, while anger proneness and social support were not. The inverse vital exhaustion-HRV association raises concern regarding the somatic manifestations of stress, a potential target for preventive interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Anish S"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Whitsel","given":"Eric A"},{"family":"Soliman","given":"Elsayed Z"},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J"}],"citation-key":"Shah2020a","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.p542","ISSN":"0009-7322","issue":"Suppl_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,3]]},"license":"All rights reserved","title":"Abstract P542: Association of Psychosocial Factors With Heart Rate Variability: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.141.suppl_1.P542","volume":"141"},

A novel heart rate variability (HRV) metric, Dyx , may be a be a potentially useful tool to study ANS dysfunction in these diseases. We propose that ANS dysfunction, measured by decreased Dyx , will associate with both depression and obstructive CAD. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We included participants undergoing coronary angiography for suspected CAD. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). HRV data were collected continuously on participants before catheterization using a new ECG patch (VivaLNK). We assessed HRV by Dyx (primary) and high and low frequency power, multiscale entropy, and deceleration capacity. Two-sample t-tests and logistic regressions (with adjustment for age and sex) were used to study the difference in HRV (before cardiac catheterization) between those with high versus low depressive burden (PHQ-9 ≥ 10), and in those with versus without obstructive CAD (>70% stenosis). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We assessed 30 individuals with mean (SD) age 62.4 (13.2); 7.1% were female and 15.4% were black. Mean Dyx in high depressive symptoms (N = 21, 70%) was 1.8 (0.2) and in none-low depressive symptoms (N = 7, 23%) was 2.2 (0.2). Differences were also observed for high frequency (HF) (4.4 (1.1) vs. 6.0 (1.4)) and deceleration capacity (−4.2 (2.1) vs. −10.7 (8.5)). Mean Dyx in obstructive CAD (N = 17, 57%) and non-obstructive CAD (N = 10, 33%) was 1.7 (0.6) and 2.6 (1.2) respectively. Differences were seen with sample entropy (1.2 (0.2) vs. 1.5 (0.2)). Every 1 unit of log(HF) had an odds ratio = 0.14 (95% CI 0.06 – 0.36) for depression. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: ANS dysfunction, measured by HRV, associates with both depression and obstructive CAD.

  {"id":"Shah2021c","abstract":"Stress, both physiological and psychological, serve as triggers for cardiovascular events in those with a damaged cardiac substrate, such as ischemic heart disease. The physiological reaction to stress is mediated through the autonomic nervous system, which can be quantified through heart rate variability (HRV). We measured HRV in three cohorts that had varying burdens of ischemic heart disease, from no known disease, high risk of disease, and known disease after myocardial infarction. Each cohort also had varying types of HRV, from short-term recordings during acute psychological and physiological stress, to longer, diurnal recordings. Two of these cohorts were followed longitudinally to assess for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Short-term and cosinor HRV metrics served as the exposure and psychological stress, myocardial ischemia, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) served as outcomes in logistic regression modeling and survival analysis. Autonomic dysfunction was robustly associated with psychological stress, myocardial ischemia, and MACE. We found a significant relationship between circadian autonomic variability and depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. We found that autonomic dysfunction was also strongly related to mental stress- induced myocardial ischemia. We found that autonomic dysfunction, both to circadian changes and acute mental stress, was associated with an increased, independent risk for MACE. This suggests that autonomic dysfunction, measured by HRV, plays an important, independent role in the additional cardiovascular risk seen in patients with psychological disease. This association highlights neurocardiac mechanisms as a not yet understood pathological process in both psychiatric and cardiovascular disease that may have implications in diagnosis and therapy.","author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Anish Sanjay"}],"citation-key":"Shah2021c","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher":"Emory University","title":"Stress Reactivity: Disturbances of the Neurocardiac Axis","type":"thesis","URL":"https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/tx31qj818"},

  {"id":"Shan2010","abstract":"During the classic \"fight-or-flight\" stress response, sympathetic nervous system activation leads to catecholamine release, which increases heart rate and contractility, resulting in enhanced cardiac output. Catecholamines bind to β-adrenergic receptors, causing cAMP generation and activation of PKA, which phosphorylates multiple targets in cardiac muscle, including the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR2) required for muscle contraction. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 enhances channel activity by sensitizing the channel to cytosolic calcium (Ca²+). Here, we found that mice harboring RyR2 channels that cannot be PKA phosphorylated (referred to herein as RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice) exhibited blunted heart rate and cardiac contractile responses to catecholamines (isoproterenol). The isoproterenol-induced enhancement of ventricular myocyte Ca²+ transients and fractional shortening (contraction) and the spontaneous beating rate of sinoatrial nodal cells were all blunted in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice. The blunted cardiac response to catecholamines in RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice resulted in impaired exercise capacity. RyR2-S2808A+/+ mice were protected against chronic catecholaminergic-induced cardiac dysfunction. These studies identify what we believe to be new roles for PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in both the heart rate and contractile responses to acute catecholaminergic stimulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Shan","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Kushnir","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Betzenhauser","given":"Matthew J"},{"family":"Reiken","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jingdong"},{"family":"Lehnart","given":"Stephan E"},{"family":"Lindegger","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Mongillo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Mohler","given":"Peter J"},{"family":"Marks","given":"Andrew R"}],"citation-key":"Shan2010","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI32726","ISSN":"00219738","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12,1]]},"page":"4388-4398","PMID":"21099118","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","title":"Phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor mediates the cardiac fight or flight response in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21099118","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"Shappell2018","abstract":"Objectives: Despite wide adoption of rapid response teams across the United States, predictors of in-hospital mortality for patients receiving rapid response team calls are poorly characterized. Identification of patients at high risk of death during hospitalization could improve triage to intensive care units and prompt timely reevaluations of goals of care. We sought to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients who are subjects of rapid response team calls and to develop and validate a predictive model for death after rapid response team call. Design: Analysis of data from the national Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team event registry. Setting: Two-hundred seventy four hospitals participating in Get with the Guidelines-Medical Emergency Team from June 2005 to February 2015. Patients: 282,710 hospitalized adults on surgical or medical wards who were subjects of a rapid response team call. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was death during hospitalization; candidate predictors included patient demographic- and event-level characteristics. Patients who died after rapid response team were older (median age 72 vs 66 yr), were more likely to be admitted for noncardiac medical illness (70% vs 58%), and had greater median length of stay prior to rapid response team (81 vs 47 hr) (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The prediction model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78-0.79), with systolic blood pressure, time since admission, and respiratory rate being the most important variables. Conclusions: Patients who die following rapid response team calls differ significantly from surviving peers. Recognition of these factors could improve postrapid response team triage decisions and prompt timely goals of care discussions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Shappell","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Edelson","given":"Dana P."},{"family":"Churpek","given":"Matthew M."}],"citation-key":"Shappell2018","container-title":"Critical Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/CCM.0000000000002926","ISSN":"15300293","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1041-1048","PMID":"29293147","publisher":"NIH Public Access","title":"Predictors of in-hospital mortality after rapid response team calls in a 274 hospital nationwide sample","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC6044728/","volume":"46"},

Decades of research has contributed to a better understanding of the anatomy and physiology of cardiac autonomic nervous system and provided evidence supporting the relationship of autonomic tone to clinically significant arrhythmias. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proarrhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in Brugada and J-wave syndromes where it can prevent them. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias. This has been achieved by either neural ablation or stimulation. Neural modulation as a treatment for arrhythmias has been well established in certain diseases, such as long QT syndrome. However, in most other arrhythmia diseases, it is still an emerging modality and under investigation. Recent preliminary trials have yielded encouraging results. Further larger-scale clinical studies are necessary before widespread application can be recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Mark J"},{"family":"Zipes","given":"Douglas P"}],"citation-key":"Shen2014","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302549","ISBN":"0009-7330","ISSN":"0009-7330","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,14]]},"page":"1004-1021","PMID":"24625726","title":"Role of the Autonomic Nervous System in Modulating Cardiac Arrhythmias","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://circres.ahajournals.org","volume":"114"},

The association between LVH and SCD is well established, especially in the presence of myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and scar tissue, and AF. Inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress, as well as ischemia play a significant role and are the leading pathways to remodeling, arrhythmias, and SCD. Aggressive HTN control may lead, at least in part, to regression of LVH and thus lower the risk of AF and SCD.

  {"id":"Shep","abstract":"Notes that depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for developing symptomatic and fatal ischemic heart disease. Moreover, depressed patients have a higher than expected rate of sudden cardiovascular death. Therefore, appropriate treatment of patients with depression and cardiovascular disease cannot be restricted to considerations of either depression or cardiovascular disease in isolation. The tricyclic antidepressants have various effects on the cardiovascular system, including Type IA antiarrhythmic activity that has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not associated with adverse cardiac effects. On the basis of this favorable cardiovascular profile, the SSRIs should therefore be the preferred choice for the treatment of most patients with comorbid depression and cardiovascular disease. Investigation of putative pathophysiologic mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular mortality, such as the role of platelet activation, will form the basis for further investigation of antidepressant treatments in order to establish if the antidepressants have a beneficial effect on the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases.

  {"id":"Shinar2006","abstract":"Autonomic function during sleep and wakefulness has been extensively investigated, however information concerning autonomic changes during the wake to sleep transition is scarce. The objective of the present study was to non-invasively characterize autonomic function and additional physiologic changes during sleep onset in normal and abnormal sleep. The estimation of autonomic function was based on time-frequency analysis of the RR interval series, using the power components in the very-low-frequency range (0.005-0.04 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), and high-frequency range (0.15-0.5 Hz). The ratio of low to high frequency power represented the sympathovagal balance. Thirty-four subjects who underwent whole night polysomnography were divided into 3 groups according to their complaints and study results: normal subjects, apneic patients (OSAS), and subjects with various sleep disorders (VSD). The results indicated a significant increase in RR interval during sleep onset, although its variability decreased; respiratory rate did not change, yet respiration became more stable; EMG amplitude and its variability decreased with sleep onset. Very-low-frequency power started to decrease significantly 2 min before sleep onset in all groups; low-frequency power decreased and high-frequency power did not change significantly in all groups, accordingly their ratio decreased and reflected a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. Although autonomic function displayed similar behavior in all subjects, OSAS and VSD patients presented a higher sympathovagal balance reflecting enhanced sympathetic predominance in those groups compared to normal subjects, both before and after sleep onset. All parameters reached a nadir at a defined time point during the process of falling asleep. We conclude that the wake-sleep transition period represents a transitional process between two physiologically different states; this transition starts with a decrease in the very slow oscillations in heart rate that anticipates a step-change resetting of autonomic function, followed by a decrease in sympathovagal balance towards the end of the process. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"Shipman2019","abstract":"Problem/Condition: Rural communities often have worse health outcomes, have less access to care, and are less diverse than urban communities. Much of the research on rural health disparities examines disparities between rural and urban communities, with fewer studies on disparities within rural communities. This report provides an overview of racial/ethnic health disparities for selected indicators in rural areas of the United States. Reporting Period: 2012-2015. Description of System: Self-reported data from the 2012-2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were pooled to evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in health, access to care, and health-related behaviors among rural residents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Using the National Center for Health Statistics 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties to assess rurality, this analysis focused on adults living in noncore (rural) counties. Results: Racial/ethnic minorities who lived in rural areas were younger (more often in the youngest age group) than non- Hispanic whites. Except for Asians and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (combined in the analysis), more racial/ ethnic minorities (compared with non-Hispanic whites) reported their health as fair or poor, that they had obesity, and that they were unable to see a physician in the past 12 months because of cost. All racial/ethnic minority populations were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to report having a personal health care provider. Non-Hispanic whites had the highest estimated prevalence of binge drinking in the past 30 days. Interpretation: Although persons in rural communities often have worse health outcomes and less access to health care than those in urban communities, rural racial/ethnic minority populations have substantial health, access to care, and lifestyle challenges that can be overlooked when considering aggregated population data. This study revealed difficulties among non-Hispanic whites as well, primarily related to health-related risk behaviors. Across each population, the challenges vary. Public Health Action: Stratifying data by different demographics, using community health needs assessments, and adopting and implementing the National Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Standards can help rural communities identify disparities and develop effective initiatives to eliminate them, which aligns with a Healthy People 2020 overarching goal: achieving health equity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Shipman","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Wendling","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Karen C."},{"family":"Kovar-Gough","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Orlowski","given":"Janis M."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Julie"}],"citation-key":"Shipman2019","container-title":"Health Affairs","DOI":"10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00924","ISSN":"0278-2715","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"page":"2011-2018","title":"The Decline In Rural Medical Students: A Growing Gap In Geographic Diversity Threatens The Rural Physician Workforce","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2019.00924","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"shu2007","abstract":"The airways of the lung develop through a reiterative process of branching morphogenesis that gives rise to the intricate and extensive surface area required for postnatal respiration. The forkhead transcription factors Foxp2 and Foxp1 are expressed in multiple foregut-derived tissues including the lung and intestine. In this report, we show that loss of Foxp2 in mouse leads to defective postnatal lung alveolarization, contributing to postnatal lethality. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that T1alpha, a lung alveolar epithelial type 1 cell-restricted gene crucial for lung development and function, is a direct target of Foxp2 and Foxp1. Remarkably, loss of a single Foxp1 allele in addition to complete loss of Foxp2 results in increased severity of morphological defects in mutant lungs and leads to perinatal loss of all Foxp2(-/-);Foxp1(+/-) mice. Expression of N-myc and Hop, crucial regulators of lung development, is compromised in Foxp2(-/-);Foxp1(+/-) mutants. In addition to the defects in lung development, esophageal muscle development is disrupted in Foxp2(-/-);Foxp1(+/-) embryos, a tissue where Foxp2 and Foxp1 are co-expressed. These data identify Foxp2 and Foxp1 as crucial regulators of lung and esophageal development, underscoring the necessity of these transcription factors in the development of anterior foregut-derived tissues and demonstrating functional cooperativity between members of the Foxp1/2/4 family in tissues where they are co-expressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2011",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Shu","given":"Weiguo"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Min Min"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuzhen"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Philip W"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Deying"},{"family":"Morrisey","given":"Edward E"}],"citation-key":"shu2007","container-title":"Development (Cambridge, England)","container-title-short":"Development","DOI":"10.1242/dev.02846","ISSN":"0950-1991","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"page":"1991-2000","PMID":"17428829","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Foxp2 and Foxp1 cooperatively regulate lung and esophagus development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17428829","volume":"134"},
  {"id":"Shusterman1998","abstract":"Objectives. We hypothesized that neurohormonal activity contributes to the initiation of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) as reflected in indices of heart rate variability (HRV). Background. Autonomic nervous system activity participates in experimental arrhythmias but clinical studies have been inconsistent. Methods. Holter electrocardiograms from 53 patients with VT were analyzed. Heart rate variability indices were determined over 5 and 15 min and 24 h and examined for changes before the onset of VT. Heart rate variability indices in the frequency domain included ultra low frequency power (FP) (ULFP): 0–0.0033 Hz; very low FP (VLFP): 0.0033–0.04 Hz; low FP (LFP): 0.04–0.15 Hz; high FP (HFP): 0.15–0.4 Hz; total power (TP); normalized LFP (LFPn); normalized HFP (HFPn), and the ratio: LFP/HFP. Results. Heart rate variability indices were severely diminished: TP: 12,009 ± 11,076 ms2; ULFP: 10,087 ± 9,565 ms2; VLFP: 1,416 ± 1,571 ms2; LFP: 544 ± 620 ms2; HFP: 161 ± 176 ms2, and LFP/HFP: 3.68 ± 2.83. Heart rate increased before VT (80.4 ± 17.3 to 85.3 ± 17.4 bpm, p < 0.001). Several HRV variables declined 30 min before VT compared to 24-h values (VLFP: −5.89 ± 17.81%, p = 0.031; LFP: −5.23 ± 14.3%, p = 0.003; HFP: −4.35 ± 13.7%, p = 0.04). LFPnand the LFP/HFP ratio decreased significantly before the onset of VT (−17.7 ± 46.9%, p = 0.035 and −8.24 ± 38.8%, p = 0.037, respectively), whereas HFPnincreased slightly (4.29 ± 29.9%, p = 0.097). Conclusions. Heart rate rose, whereas LFP, LFPnand LFP/HFP fell before the onset of VT. This pattern of changes could be explained by a rise in sympathetic activity and saturation of the HRV signal resulting in dissociation of the average and rhythmical effects of sympathetic activity. These findings suggest that alterations in autonomic activity contributed to arrhythmogenesis in this group of patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shusterman","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Aysin","given":"Benhur"},{"family":"Gottipaty","given":"Venkateshwar"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Raul"},{"family":"Brode","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Schwartzman","given":"David"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kelley P."}],"citation-key":"Shusterman1998","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","container-title-short":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/S0735-1097(98)00468-9","ISSN":"0735-1097","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",12,1]]},"page":"1891-1899","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Autonomic nervous system activity and the spontaneous initiation of ventricular tachycardia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109798004689","volume":"32"},

They attach to the septum, to the papillary muscles, or to the free wall of the ventricle but not to the mitral valve. They are found in approximately half of human hearts examined at autopsy. Although it has been more than 100 years since their initial description, the functional significance of these structures remains largely unexplored. It has been suggested that they retard LV remodeling by tethering the walls to which they are attached, but there are few data to substantiate this. Some studies have suggested that false tendons reduce the severity of functional mitral regurgitation by stabilizing the position of the papillary muscles as the left ventricle enlarges. LV false tendons may also have deleterious effects and have been implicated in promoting membrane formation in discrete subaortic stenosis.

  {"id":"Silva2020","abstract":"The confidence of medical equipment is intimately related to false alarms. The higher the number of false events occurs, the less truthful is the equipment. In this sense, reducing (or suppressing) false positive alarms is hugely desirable. In this work, we propose a feasible and real-time approach that works as a validation method for a heartbeat segmentation third-party algorithm. The approach is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which may be embedded in dedicated hardware. Our proposal aims to detect the pattern of a single heartbeat and classifies them into two classes: a heartbeat and not a heartbeat. For this, a seven-layer convolution network is employed for both data representation and classification. We evaluate our approach in two well-settled databases in the literature on the raw heartbeat signal. The first database is a conventional on-the-person database called MIT-BIH, and the second is one less uncontrolled off-the-person type database known as CYBHi. To evaluate the feasibility and the performance of the proposed approach, we use as a baseline the Pam-Tompkins algorithm, which is a well-known method in the literature and still used in the industry. We compare the baseline against the proposed approach: a CNN model validating the heartbeats detected by a third-party algorithm. In this work, the third-party algorithm is the same as the baseline for comparison purposes. The results support the feasibility of our approach showing that our method can enhance the positive prediction of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm from $$97.84\\%$$/$$90.28\\%$$to $$100.00\\%$$/$$96.77\\%$$by slightly decreasing the sensitivity from $$95.79\\%$$/$$96.95\\%$$to $$92.98\\%/$$$$95.71\\%$$on the MIT-BIH/CYBHi databases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Luz","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Guilherme"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Gladston"},{"family":"Wanner","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Flavio"},{"family":"Menotti","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Silva2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-77745-0","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,26]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"20701","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Towards better heartbeat segmentation with deep learning classification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77745-0","volume":"10"},

Nevertheless, several critical questions about learned vocal motor control still remain open. One of them is the mechanism(s) by which neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, modulate speech and song production. In this review, we bring together the two fields of investigations of dopamine action on voice control in humans and songbirds, who share similar behavioral and neural mechanisms for speech and song production. While human studies investigating the role of dopamine in speech control are limited to reports in neurological patients, research on dopaminergic modulation of bird song control has recently expanded our views on how this system might be organized. We discuss the parallels between bird song and human speech from the perspective of dopaminergic control as well as outline important differences between these species.","author":[{"family":"Simonyan","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Horwitz","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Jarvis","given":"Erich D"}],"citation-key":"simonyan2012","container-title":"Brain and language","container-title-short":"Brain Lang","DOI":"10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.009","ISSN":"1090-2155","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"142-150","PMID":"22284300","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Dopamine regulation of human speech and bird song: a critical review","title-short":"Dopamine regulation of human speech and bird song","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

  {"id":"Singh2013","abstract":"Autonomic imbalances including parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic overactivity are cardinal features of heart failure regardless of etiology; however, mechanisms underlying these imbalances remain unknown. Animal model studies of heart and visceral organ hypertrophy predict that nerve growth factor levels should be elevated in heart failure; whether this is so in human heart failure, though, remains unclear. We tested the hypotheses that neurons in cardiac ganglia are hypertrophied in human, canine, and rat heart failure and that nerve growth factor, which we hypothesize is elevated in the failing heart, contributes to this neuronal hypertrophy. Somal morphology of neurons from human (579.54±14.34 versus 327.45±9.17 μm(2); P<0.01) and canine hearts (767.80±18.37 versus 650.23±9.84 μm(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to ischemia and neurons from spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts (327.98±3.15 versus 271.29±2.79 μm(2); P<0.01) failing secondary to hypertension reveal significant hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia compared with controls. Western blot analysis shows that nerve growth factor levels in the explanted, failing human heart are 250% greater than levels in healthy donor hearts. Neurons from cardiac ganglia cultured with nerve growth factor are significantly larger and have greater dendritic arborization than neurons in control cultures. Hypertrophied neurons are significantly less excitable than smaller ones; thus, hypertrophy of vagal postganglionic neurons in cardiac ganglia would help to explain the parasympathetic withdrawal that accompanies heart failure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that nerve growth factor, which is elevated in the failing human heart, causes hypertrophy of neurons in cardiac ganglia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Sanjay"},{"family":"Sayers","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Walter","given":"James S"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Dieter","given":"Robert S"},{"family":"Nee","given":"Lisa M"},{"family":"Wurster","given":"Robert D"}],"citation-key":"Singh2013","container-title":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.113.000210","ISSN":"20479980","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"title":"Hypertrophy of neurons within cardiac ganglia in human, canine, and rat heart failure: the potential role of nerve growth factor.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rsbweb.","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"Sinnreich1998","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability of short recordings of heart rate variability (HRV) with time, and the association of HRV with age and sex. DESIGN: Five minute Holter recordings were made twice over a two month interval (tracking study). In addition, HRV was measured in a cross sectional study. SETTING: Residents of 11 Israeli kibbutzim were examined in their settlements. SUBJECTS: 32 men and 38 women (aged 31-67) participated in the tracking study and 294 (aged 35-65) were involved in the cross sectional study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time and frequency domain analyses on Holter recordings were undertaken in two breathing conditions: spontaneous and controlled breathing (15 respirations per minute). Regression was used to assess the relations of sex, age, heart rate, and logarithmically transformed HRV indices. RESULTS: HRV measures were highly consistent with time with correlations of 0.76-0.80 for high frequency and total power. Geometric mean total power declined with age by 45% in men and 32% in women, and was lower by 24% among women than among men (all p < or = 0.005). Men had a 34% higher very low and low frequency power and a higher ratio of low to high frequency power (p < 0.001). Conversely, high frequency power in women represents a greater proportion of total power than in men. CONCLUSION: Short recordings of HRV in a non-laboratory setting are stable over months and therefore characteristic of an individual. Strong age and sex effects were evident. HRV derived from short recordings can be informative in population based studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinnreich","given":"R"},{"family":"Kark","given":"J D"},{"family":"Friedlander","given":"Y"},{"family":"Sapoznikov","given":"D"},{"family":"Luria","given":"M H"}],"citation-key":"Sinnreich1998","container-title":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/hrt.80.2.156","ISSN":"13556037","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"156-162","title":"Five minute recordings of heart rate variability for population studies: Repeatability and age-sex characteristics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://heart.bmj.com/","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"Siontis2020","abstract":"Machine learning applications in cardiology have rapidly evolved in the past decade. With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities. This review critically appraises the advances of machine learning related to the care of AF thus far, their potential future directions, and its potential limitations and challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Siontis","given":"Konstantinos C."},{"family":"Yao","given":"Xiaoxi"},{"family":"Pirruccello","given":"James P."},{"family":"Philippakis","given":"Anthony A."},{"family":"Noseworthy","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"Siontis2020","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316401","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,19]]},"page":"155-169","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"How Will Machine Learning Inform the Clinical Care of Atrial Fibrillation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316401","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"Siontis2021","abstract":"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a ubiquitous and standardized test, is an example of the ongoing transformative effect of AI on cardiovascular medicine. Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person’s age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Siontis","given":"Konstantinos C."},{"family":"Noseworthy","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Attia","given":"Zachi I."},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Paul A."}],"citation-key":"Siontis2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Cardiology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Cardiol","DOI":"10.1038/s41569-020-00503-2","ISSN":"1759-5010","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"7","page":"465-478","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography in cardiovascular disease management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-00503-2","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"slostad2021","abstract":"Aortic valve calcium (AVC) is a strong predictor of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and is typically calculated by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). We propose a novel method using pixel density quantification software to objectively quantify AVC by two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and distinguish severe from non-severe AS. A total of 90 patients (mean age 76 ± 10 years, 75% male, mean AV gradient 32 ± 11 mmHg, peak AV velocity 3.6 ± 0.6 m/s, AV area (AVA) 1.0 ± 0.3 cm2, dimensionless index (DI) 0.27 ± 0.08) with suspected severe aortic stenosis undergoing 2D echocardiography were retrospectively evaluated. Parasternal short axis aortic valve views were used to calculate a gain-independent ratio between the average pixel density of the entire aortic valve in short axis at end diastole and the average pixel density of the aortic annulus in short axis (2D-AVC ratio). The 2D-AVC ratio was compared to echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters associated with AS, MDCT AVC quantification, and expert reader interpretation of AS severity based on echocardiographic AVC interpretation. The 2D-AVC ratio exhibited strong correlations with mean AV gradient (r = 0.72, p < 0.001), peak AV velocity (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), AVC quantified by MDCT (r = 0.71, p <0.001) and excellent accuracy in distinguishing severe from non-severe AS (area under the curve = 0.93). Conversely, expert reader interpretation of AS severity based on echocardiographic AVC was not significantly related to AV mean gradient (t = 0.23, p = 0.64), AVA (t = 2.94, p = 0.11), peak velocity (t = 0.59, p = 0.46), or DI (t = 0.02, p = 0.89). In conclusion, these data suggest that the 2D-AVC ratio may be a complementary method for AS severity adjudication that is readily quantifiable at time of TTE.","author":[{"family":"Slostad","given":"Brody"},{"family":"Twing","given":"Aamir"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Auseon","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Groves","given":"Elliott"},{"family":"Frazin","given":"Leon"},{"family":"Kansal","given":"Mayank"}],"citation-key":"slostad2021","container-title":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.07.002","ISSN":"18791913","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"108-113","PMID":"34344508","title":"A Novel Two-Dimensional Echocardiography Method to Objectively Quantify Aortic Valve Calcium and Predict Aortic Stenosis Severity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.07.002","volume":"156"},

  {"id":"Smith2018","abstract":"Sudden cardiac death accounted for 42% of all firefighter duty-related fatalities over the last decade. This retrospective study analyzed available medical examiner records for duty-related firefighter fatalities among male firefighters 18 to 65 years of age that occurred between 1999 and 2014 and reported the pathoanatomic substrate for cardiac-related fatalities. Odds of duty-related cardiac death during specific duties compared with fire station duties were calculated by pathoanatomic substrate. There were 285 cardiac fatalities. Of fatalities, 80% had evidence at autopsy of coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased heart size (cardiomegaly and/or left ventricular hypertrophy). CHD alone, cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy, and causes other than CHD or increased heart size were identified in 7.7%, 6.0%, and 6.7% of fatalities, respectively. The largest proportion of deaths occurred during fire suppression (33%), although only 1% of annual occupational time was estimated to be spent performing this duty. For deaths attributed to CHD and increased heart size, fire suppression, alarm response, and physical training were associated with approximately a 112-fold, eightfold, and sevenfold increased risk of cardiac death, respectively, compared with station duties. In conclusion, the majority of firefighters who suffered a duty-related cardiac death had CHD and increased heart size, which was associated with a markedly increased risk of death during fire suppression compared with station duties. Targeted occupational medical screening for CHD and increased heart size may reduce duty-related cardiac deaths among firefighters.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Denise L."},{"family":"Haller","given":"Jeannie M."},{"family":"Korre","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Sampani","given":"Konstantina"},{"family":"Porto","given":"Luiz G.Grossi"},{"family":"Fehling","given":"Patricia C."},{"family":"Christophi","given":"Costas A."},{"family":"Kales","given":"Stefanos N."}],"citation-key":"Smith2018","container-title":"American Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjcard.2018.11.049","ISSN":"18791913","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"title":"The Relation of Emergency Duties to Cardiac Death Among US Firefighters","type":"article-newspaper","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002914918321544?dgcid=rss_sd_all"},
  {"id":"Smolderen2009","abstract":"Background-Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), depression is both common and underrecognized. The association of different manifestations of depression, somatic and cognitive, with depression recognition and long-term prognosis is poorly understood. Methods and Results-Depression was confirmed in 481 AMI patients enrolled from 21 sites during their index hospitalization with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Within the PHQ-9, separate somatic and cognitive symptom scores were derived, and the independent association between these domains and the clinical recognition of depression, as documented in the medical records, was evaluated. In a separate multisite AMI registry of 2347 patients, the association between somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms and 4-year all-cause mortality and 1-year all-cause rehospitalization was evaluated. Depression was clinically recognized in 29% (n=140) of patients. Cognitive depressive symptoms (relative risk per SD increase, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.26; P≥0.01) were independently associated with depression recognition, whereas the association for somatic symptoms and recognition (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.26; P=0.66) was not significant. However, unadjusted Cox regression analyses found that only somatic depressive symptoms were associated with 4-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.39) or 1-year rehospitalization (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.33), whereas cognitive manifestations were not (HR for mortality, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; HR for rehospitalization, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.11). After multivariable adjustment, the association between somatic symptoms and rehospitalization persisted (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P=0.01) but was attenuated for mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.21; P=0.30). Conclusions-Depression after AMI was recognized in fewer than 1 in 3 patients. Although cognitive symptoms were associated with recognition of depression, somatic symptoms were associa ed with long-term outcomes.

  {"id":"Smolderen2012","abstract":"Background: Somatic depressive symptoms and certain biomarkers are each associated with worse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prognosis, but the relationship between depressive symptom domains and inflammatory, neurohormonal, and coagulation markers is unknown. Methods: We examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and 1-month biomarker levels (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], white blood cell [WBC], platelet counts) in 1265 AMI patients. Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed during index hospitalization and categorized as somatic or cognitive. Using median regression models, the upper quartile of somatic and cognitive depression scores and each biomarker were compared with the lower three quartiles, adjusting for site, demographics, and clinical characteristics. Results: Although hs-CRP values were higher in patients with somatic symptoms, this association was attenuated after adjustment (B per SD increase =.02, 95% confidence interval:.00;.05, p =.07). WBC count was independently associated with somatic depressive symptoms (B per SD increase =.28, 95% confidence interval:.12;.44, p <.001). Cognitive depressive symptoms were not associated with hs-CRP or WBC count. Neither dimension was associated with NT-proBNP or platelet levels. For each biomarker, the depression dimensions explained <1% of their variation.

  {"id":"Smolderen2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND Depression among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for depression, it is unclear whether treatment of depression in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated depression differs. METHODS The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients' Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. Depression was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. Depression was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for depression, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no depression (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated depression; and (3) untreated depression adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors. RESULTS Overall, 759 (18.7%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for depression and 231 (30.4%) were treated. In comparison with 3303 patients without depression, the 231 patients with treated depression had 1-year mortality rates that were not different (6.1% versus 6.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.99). In contrast, the 528 patients with untreated depression had higher 1-year mortality in comparison with patients without depression (10.8% versus 6.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.62). CONCLUSIONS Although depression in patients with AMI is associated with increased long-term mortality, this association may be confined to patients with untreated depression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Smolderen","given":"Kim G."},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Donna M."},{"family":"Gosch","given":"Kensey"},{"family":"Whooley","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Paul S."},{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Parashar","given":"Susmita"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Ho","given":"P.

  {"id":"Smoller2013","abstract":"Background: Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33 332 cases and 27 888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples. Findings: SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers. Interpretation: Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Smoller","given":"Jordan W."},{"family":"Kendler","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Craddock","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Phil Hyoun"},{"family":"Neale","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Nurnberger","given":"John N."},{"family":"Ripke","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Santangelo","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Patrick S."},{"family":"Neale","given":"Benjamin N."},{"family":"Purcell","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Anney","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Buitelaar","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Fanous","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Faraone","given":"Stephen F."},{"family":"Hoogendijk","given":"Witte"},{"family":"Lesch","given":"Klaus Peter"},{"family":"Levinson","given":"Douglas L."},{"family":"Perlis","given":"Roy P."},{"family":"Rietschel","given":"Marcella"},{"family":"Riley","given":"Brien"},{"family":"Sonuga-Barke","given":"Edmund"},{"family":"Schachar","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Schulze","given":"Thomas S."},{"family":"Thapar","given":"Anita"},{"family":"Kendler","given":"Kenneth K."},{"family":"Smoller","given":"Jordan S."},{"family":"Neale","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Perlis","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Cichon","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Daly","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Kelsoe","given":"John"},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Levinson","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"O'Donovan","given":"Mick"},{"family":"Gejman","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Sebat","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Sklar","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Daly","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Devlin","given":"Bernie"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"O'Donovan","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Smoller2013","container-title":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62129-1","ISBN":"1474-547X (Electronic)\\r0140-6736 (Linking)","ISSN":"01406736","issue":"9875","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,20]]},"page":"1371-1379","PMID":"23453885","title":"Identification of risk loci with shared effects on five major psychiatric disorders: a genome-wide analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453885","volume":"381"},

  {"id":"Soejima2002","abstract":"Background - We hypothesized that delineating electrically unexcitable scar (EUS) within low-voltage infarct regions will locate reentry circuit isthmuses by defining their borders. The pacing threshold and electrogram amplitude that best determines EUS is unknown. Methods and Results - The change in dimension of the virtual electrode was estimated in 11 patients and observed to increase by 4.4±2.5 mm as stimulus strength increases from threshold (2.9±1.8 mA) to 10 mA. EUS was defined as a threshold > 10 mA. In 14 consecutive patients, mapping and ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were performed using an electroanatomic mapping system. During sinus rhythm, unipolar pacing was performed at sites with bipolar electrogram amplitude < 1.5 mV. EUS regions were marked on the maps. Reentry circuit isthmuses were identified by entrainment mapping or pace mapping, and ablation was performed. EUS was identified in the infarct in all 14 patients (11.8±13.9 cm2). All 20 VT circuit isthmuses identified were adjacent to EUS. Although electrogram amplitude correlated with pacing threshold (r=0.64, P<0.0001), many isthmuses had very low-amplitude electrograms, and EUS could not be identified from electrogram amplitude alone. RF ablation lines connecting selected EUS regions abolished all inducible VTs in 10 patients (71%); spontaneous VT was markedly reduced during follow-up (from 142±360 to 0.9±2.0 episodes per month, P=0.002). Conclusions - This new method of identifying EUS provides complimentary information to the electrogram amplitude in delineating potential reentry circuit paths, potentially facilitating ablation during sinus rhythm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Soejima","given":"Kyoko"},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"William G."},{"family":"Maisel","given":"William H."},{"family":"Sapp","given":"John L."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Laurence M."}],"citation-key":"Soejima2002","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.0000030187.39852.A7","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",9,24]]},"page":"1678-1683","PMID":"12270862","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","title":"Electrically unexcitable scar mapping based on pacing threshold for identification of the reentry circuit isthmus: Feasibility for guiding ventricular tachycardia ablation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.0000030187.39852.A7","volume":"106"},

Rather, we offer some general analytic principles as they apply to electrophysiology (EP) and illustrate their use through several examples. Our hope is to provide a framework for thinking about electrogram data that acts more like a compass and map than like a specific set of directions. Amongst the most helpful pieces of advice that we can offer the EP trainee is to actively try to picture the waves of electricity spreading through the heart, passing beneath the recording electrodes and generating the electrograms you seek to interpret. Digest the fact that more than one propagation pattern can result in the same electrogram pattern and that differential diagnostic pacing is aimed at distinguishing between these possibilities. A fundamental tenet of differential diagnostic maneuvers of any kind (not simply pacing) is to choose a test that maximizes the difference between possible explanations. This perspective and a careful and meticulous cataloguing of what you can unambiguously conclude from the electrograms versus what remains to be determined via pacing offers the best approach to succeeding at EP. We will discuss pacing maneuvers in three contexts: differential diagnosis of narrow complex tachycardia, mapping of accessory pathways, and Para-Hisian pacing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Spector","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Habel","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"Spector2014","container-title":"Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/pace.12425","ISSN":"1540-8159","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","page":"909-922","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Principles of Differential Diagnostic Pacing Maneuvers: Serial versus Parallel Conduction","title-short":"Principles of Differential Diagnostic Pacing Maneuvers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pace.12425","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"Spiesshoefer2022","abstract":"Background: Periodic breathing (PB) is a cyclical breathing pattern composed of alternating periods of hyperventilation (hyperpnea, HP) and central apnea (CA). Differences in PB phenotypes mainly reside in HP length. Given that respiration modulates muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), which decreases during HP and increases during CA, the net effects of PB on MSNA may critically depend on HP length.Objectives: We hypothesized that PB with shorter periods of HP is associated with increased MSNA and decreased heart rate variability.Methods: 10 healthy participants underwent microelectrode recordings of MSNA from the common peroneal nerve along with non-invasive recording of HRV, blood pressure and respiration. Following a 10-min period of tidal breathing, participants were asked to simulate PB for 3 min following a computed respiratory waveform that emulated two PB patterns, comprising a constant CA of 20 s duration and HP of two different lengths: short (20 s) vs long (40 s). Results: Compared to (3 min of) normal breathing, simulated PB with short HP resulted in a marked increase in mean and maximum MSNA amplitude (from 3.2 ± 0.8 to 3.4 ± 0.8 µV, p = 0.04; from 3.8 ± 0.9 to 4.3 ± 1.1 µV, p = 0.04, respectively). This was paralleled by an increase in LF/HF ratio of heart rate variability (from 0.9 ± 0.5 to 2.0 ± 1.3; p = 0.04). In contrast, MSNA response to simulated PB with long HP did not change as compared to normal breathing. Single CA events consistently resulted in markedly increased MSNA (all p < 0.01) when compared to the preceding HPs, while periods of HP, regardless of duration, decreased MSNA (p < 0.05) when compared to normal breathing.Conclusion: Overall, the net effects of PB in healthy subjects over time on MSNA are dependent on the relative duration of HP: increased sympathetic outflow is seen during PB with a short but not with a long period of HP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Spiesshoefer","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Giannoni","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Borrelli","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Sciarrone","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Husstedt","given":"Imke"},{"family":"Emdin","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Passino","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Kahles","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Dawood","given":"Tye"},{"family":"Regmi","given":"Binaya"},{"family":"Naughton","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Dreher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Boentert","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Macefield","given":"Vaughan G."}],"citation-key":"Spiesshoefer2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","ISSN":"1664-042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Effects of hyperventilation length on muscle sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans simulating periodic breathing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.934372","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Srinivasan2009","abstract":"Profound disturbances in sleep architecture occur in major depressive disorders (MDD) and in bipolar affective disorders. Reduction in slow wave sleep, decreased latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and abnormalities in the timing of REM/non-REM sleep cycles have all been documented in patients with MDD. It is thus evident that an understanding of the basic mechanisms of sleep regulation is essential for an analysis of the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as the body's master circadian clock, plays a major role in the regulation of the sleep/wakefulness rhythm and interacts actively with the homeostatic processes that regulate sleep. The control of melatonin secretion by the SCN, the occurrence of high concentrations of melatonin receptors in the SCN, and the suppression of electrical activity in the SCN by melatonin all underscore the major influence which this neurohormone has in regulating the sleep/wake cycle. The transition from wakefulness to high sleep propensity is associated with the nocturnal rise of endogenous melatonin secretion. Various lines of evidence show that depressed patients exhibit disturbances in both the amplitude and shape of the melatonin secretion rhythm and that melatonin can improve the quality of sleep in these patients. The choice of a suitable antidepressant that improves sleep quality is thus important while treating a depressive disorder. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, which combines the properties of a 5-HT2C antagonist and a melatonergic MT1/MT2 receptor agonist, has been found very effective for resetting the disturbed sleep/wake cycle and in improving the clinical status of MDD. Agomelatine has also been found useful in treating sleep problems and improving the clinical status of patients suffering from seasonal affective disorder. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  {"id":"Srinivasan2018","abstract":"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and arrhythmia represent a major worldwide public health problem, accounting for 15–20 % of all deaths. Early resuscitation and defibrillation remains the key to survival, yet its implementation and the access to public defibrillators remains poor, resulting in overall poor survival to patients discharged from hospital. Novel approaches employing smart technology may provide the solution to this dilemma. Though the majority of cases are attributable to coronary artery disease, a thorough search for an underlying cause in cases where the diagnosis is unclear is necessary. This enables better management of arrhythmia recurrence and screening of family members. The majority of cases of SCD occur in patients who do not have traditional risk factors for arrhythmia. New and improved large scale screening tools are required to better predict risk in the wider population who represent the majority of cases of SCD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Neil T"},{"family":"Schilling","given":"Richard J"}],"citation-key":"Srinivasan2018","container-title":"Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology Review","container-title-short":"Arrhythm Electrophysiol Rev","DOI":"10.15420/aer.2018:15:2","ISSN":"2050-3369","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"page":"111-117","PMCID":"PMC6020177","PMID":"29967683","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Sudden Cardiac Death and Arrhythmias","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020177/","volume":"7"},

Doses of 180 to 200 mg ciprofloxacin (as a lactic acid solution) were placed in the HF-capsule and ad-ministered to four healthy male adults. The posi-tion of the HF-capsule in the gastrointestinal tract was checked via radiographic examination. The release of the solution from the HF-capsule was induced by a radio signal.

Two control runs (Al, A,), involving oral administration of the solution, were used as a reference for calcu-lation of area under the curve. The oral adminis-tration of a conventional 250-mg tablet (A,) was also studied. The plasma concentration of cipro-floxacin and urine concentrations of ciprofloxa-tin, desethylene-(Ml), sulfo-(M2), and oxo-ciprofloxacin (M3) were determined fluorimetri-tally by high-performance liquid chromatogra-phy. Intraindividual comparisons indicated a pro-gressive decrease in the amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed (100 percent = mean of AUCA1 and AUCAJ from the jejunum (-61 percent, median), ileum (-75 percent), colon ascendens (-90 per-cent), and colon descendens (-95 percent). Abso-lute amounts of renally excreted ciprofloxacin and metabolites decreased due to the reduced absorption of ciprofloxacin, but the metabolite pattern was unchanged.

Complex, nonencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated afferents have been known to exist for many years. More recently, however, indirect evidence for the existence of cardiac receptors that are either silent or exhibit low resting rates of activity, and discharge into slowly conducting C-type fibers, has been demonstrated. The receptors themselves have not yet been identified histologically. Cardiac receptors include subpopulations that are preferenthlly activated by chemical stimuli, including a variety of exogenous chemicals as well as prostaglandins. Another subpopulation is preferentially activated by mechanical stresses in the physiological range. Further investigation may reveal their participation in overall cardiovascular regulation, and mediation of responses to exogenous chemical stimuli. Four principal cardiac sympathetic nerves have been identified in the right thoracic region and three on the left. Most carry sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Stimulation of individual nerves, before and after parasympathetic blockade, results in regionally, well-defined myocardial responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Stee","given":"E W Van"}],"citation-key":"Stee1978","container-title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","DOI":"10.2307/3428837","ISSN":"00916765","issued":{"date-parts":[["1978",10]]},"page":"151","title":"Autonomic Innervation of the Heart","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3428837?origin=crossref","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"Steenland2004a","abstract":"Dose-response modeling in occupational epidemiology is usually motivated by questions of causal inference (eg, is there a monotonic increase of risk with increasing exposure?) or risk assessment (eg, how much excess risk exists at any given level of exposure?). We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of \"smoothing\" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most \"true\" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios).

Methods: Heart rate variability was measured during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in 40 medically stable out-patients with documented coronary heart disease meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depression, and 32 nondepressed, but otherwise comparable, patients. Patients discontinued β-blockers and antidepressant medications at the time of study. Depressed patients were classified as mildly (n = 21) or moderately-to-severely depressed (n = 19) on the basis of Beck Depression Inventory scores. Results: There were no significant differences among the groups in age, gender, blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or smoking. Heart rates were higher and nearly all indices of heart rate variability were significantly reduced in the moderately-to-severely versus the nondepressed group. Heart rates were also higher and mean values for heart rate variability lower in the mildly depressed group compared with the nondepressed group, but these differences did not attain statistical significance. Conclusion: The association of moderate to severe depression with reduced heart rate variability in patients with stable coronary heart disease may reflect altered cardiac autonomic modulation and may explain their increased risk for mortality.

  {"id":"Stein2005","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and abnormal nonlinear HRV shortly after myocardial infarction (MI) are risk factors for mortality. Traditional HRV predicts mortality in patients with a range of times post-MI, but the association of nonlinear HRV and outcome in this population is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: HRV was determined from 740 tapes recorded before antiarrhythmic therapy in Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial patients with ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) suppressed on the first randomized treatment. Patients were 70 +/- 121 days post-MI. Follow up was 362 +/- 241 days (70 deaths). The association between traditional time and frequency-domain HRV and mortality and nonlinear HRV and mortality were compared for the entire population (ALL), those without coronary artery bypass graft post-MI (no CABG), and those without CABG or diabetes (no CABG, no DIAB) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Strength of association was compared by P values and Wald Chi-square values. Nonlinear HRV included short-term fractal scaling exponent, power law slope, and SD12 (Poincare dimension). For ALL and for no CABG, increased daytime SD12 had the strongest association with mortality (P=0.002 ALL and P <0.001 no CABG). For no CABG, no DIAB increased 24-hour SD12 hours had the strongest association (P <0.001) with mortality. Upon multivariate analysis, increased SD12, decreased ln ULF (ultra low frequency), and history of prior MI and history of congestive heart failure each remained in the model. CONCLUSION: Nonlinear HRV is associated with mortality post-MI. However, as with traditional HRV, this is diluted by CABG surgery post-MI and by diabetes. Results suggest that decreased long-term HRV and increased randomness of heart rate are each independent risk factors for mortality post-MI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Stein","given":"Phyllis K."},{"family":"Domitrovich","given":"Peter P."},{"family":"Huikuri","given":"Heikki V."},{"family":"Kleiger","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"Stein2005","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1540-8167.2005.04358.x","ISBN":"3142861394","ISSN":"10453873","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,1]]},"page":"13-20","PMID":"15673380","publisher":"Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)","title":"Traditional and nonlinear heart rate variability are each independently associated with mortality after myocardial infarction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1046/j.1540-8167.2005.04358.x","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"Stein2006","abstract":"The amount of time between heartbeats is controlled by the rate of depolarization of the sinoatrial node. This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.","author":[{"family":"Stein","given":"Phyllis K."},{"family":"Lundequam","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Clauw","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Freedland","given":"Kenneth E."},{"family":"Carney","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Domitrovich","given":"Peter P."}],"citation-key":"Stein2006","container-title":"Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings","DOI":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259558","ISBN":"1424400325","ISSN":"05891019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"429-432","PMID":"17946831","title":"Circadian and ultradian rhythms in cardiac autonomic modulation","type":"article-journal"},

We therefore assessed the extent to which the association between social isolation and mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in 2004-2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March 2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox proportional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. However, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and baseline health, social isolation remained significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.09). The association of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with social isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely to be more relevant to mortality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Steptoe","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Aparna"},{"family":"Demakakos","given":"Panayotes"},{"family":"Wardle","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"Steptoe2013a","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1219686110","ISSN":"00278424","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,9]]},"page":"5797-5801","PMID":"23530191","title":"Social isolation, loneliness, and all-cause mortality in older men and women","type":"article-journal","volume":"110"},

Although the normal physiological function of PNECs and neuropeptides in normal adult lungs and in repair from lung injury is not known, PNEC hyperplasia has been associated with chronic lung diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and with chronic exposures, such as hypoxia, tobacco smoke, nitrosamines, and ozone.

Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that, at the dose used in this study, selectively destroys nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells (Clara cells) through cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolic activation into cytotoxic epoxides. PNECs were identified by immunohistochemical analysis of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-IR). Proliferating cells were marked with [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. Acute naphthalene toxicity results in PNEC hyperplasia that is detectable after 5 days of recovery. PNEC hyperplasia is characterized by increased numbers of NEBs without significant changes in the number of isolated PNECs and by increased [(3)H]thymidine labeling of CGRP-IR cells.

We prospectively compared physical signs with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure (ejection fraction, .18 +/- .06). Rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressure were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg, for which the combination of these signs had 58% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Proportional pulse pressure correlated well with cardiac index (r = .82), and when less than 25% pulse pressure had 91% sensitivity and 83% specificity for a cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m2. In chronic heart failure, reliance on physical signs for elevated ventricular filling pressure might result in inadequate therapy. Conversely, the adequacy of cardiac output is assessed reliably by pulse pressure. Our results facilitate decisions regarding treatment in chronic heart failure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Lynne Warner"},{"family":"Perloff","given":"Joseph K."}],"citation-key":"Stevenson1989","container-title":"JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.1989.03420060100040","ISBN":"0098-7484 (Print)\\r0098-7484 (Linking)","ISSN":"15383598","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",2,10]]},"page":"884-888","PMID":"2913385","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"The Limited Reliability of Physical Signs for Estimating Hemodynamics in Chronic Heart Failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1989.03420060100040","volume":"261"},
  {"id":"Stickrath2013","abstract":"IMPORTANCE: General medicine rounds by attending physicians provide the foundation for patient care and education in teaching hospitals. However, the detailed activities of these rounds in the current era are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of attending rounds for internal medicine inpatients in a large teaching hospital system. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study of attending rounds in internal medicine. Rounds were observed directly by research assistants. SETTING: Four teaching hospitals associated with a large public medical school. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six attending physicians and 279 trainees treating 807 general medicine inpatients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Duration and location of rounds, composition of teams, and frequency of 19 potential activities during rounds. RESULTS: We observed 90 days of rounds. A typical rounding day consisted of 1 attending with 3 trainees visiting a median of 9 (range, 2-18 [SD, 2.9]) patients for a median of 2.0 hours (range, 25-241 [SD, 2.7] minutes). On rounds, teams most frequently discussed the patient care plan (96.7% of patients), reviewed diagnostic studies (90.7%), communicated with patients (73.4%), and discussed the medication list (68.8%). Teams infrequently discussed invasive lines or tubes (9.3%) or nursing notes (6.2%) and rarely communicated with nurses (12.0%) or taught physical examination skills (14.6%), evidence-based medicine topics (7.2%), or learner-identified topics (3.2%). Many commonly performed activities occurred infrequently at the bedside. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most activities on attending rounds do not take place at the bedside. The teams discuss patient care plans and test results most of the time but fail to include many items that may be of significant value, including specific aspects of patient care, interprofessional communication, and learner-centered education. Future studies are needed to further assess the implications of these observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Stickrath","given":"Chad"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Prochazka","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Mel"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Manheim","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Sillau","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Aagaard","given":"Eva"}],"citation-key":"Stickrath2013","container-title":"JAMA Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.6041","ISBN":"2168-6114","ISSN":"21686106","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,24]]},"page":"1084-1089","PMID":"23649040","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Attending rounds in the current era: What is and is not happening","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.6041","volume":"173"},
  {"id":"Stone2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND Among patients with heart failure who have mitral regurgitation due to left ventricular dysfunction, the prognosis is poor. Transcatheter mitral-valve repair may improve their clinical outcomes. METHODS At 78 sites in the United States and Canada, we enrolled patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy (device group) or medical therapy alone (control group). The primary effectiveness end point was all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months of follow-up. The primary safety end point was freedom from device-related complications at 12 months; the rate for this end point was compared with a prespecified objective performance goal of 88.0%. RESULTS Of the 614 patients who were enrolled in the trial, 302 were assigned to the device group and 312 to the control group. The annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months was 35.8% per patient-year in the device group as compared with 67.9% per patient-year in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.70; P<0.001). The rate of freedom from device-related complications at 12 months was 96.6% (lower 95% confidence limit, 94.8%; P<0.001 for comparison with the performance goal). Death from any cause within 24 months occurred in 29.1% of the patients in the device group as compared with 46.1% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation who remained symptomatic despite the use of maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy, transcatheter mitral-valve repair resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure and lower all-cause mortality within 24 months of follow-up than medical therapy alone. The rate of freedom from device-related complications exceeded a prespecified safety threshold.

Gradual increases of the frequency of vagal stimulation gradually enhanced the inhibitory effect on heart rate both before and during exercise. During exercise, heart rate reduction was significantly greater than that produced at rest at any frequency of stimulation (P less than 0.001). This difference widened as the frequency of stimulation increased and the interaction with or without the presence of exercise was significant (P less than 0.02).

  {"id":"Strange2008","abstract":"We all know that authorship is important. It dictates the course and success of a scientist's career and confers enormous responsibility. However, despite its importance, it is clear that authorship abuse is not an infrequent occurrence. Indeed, of the various forms of unethical scientific conduct, I suspect that authorship abuse is the most prevalent and most tolerated. Authorship is awarded promiscuously as an expedient solution to real or perceived problems and due to outright unethical and unprofessional behavior. It is essential that as scientists we work together with our institutions, our professional organizations, and the journals we publish in to establish uniform authorship policies and practices that will minimize authorship abuse and that we train our students and fellows in the highest standards of publication ethics. Some might argue that the establishment of formal authorship policies and having written authorship agreements between investigators could hinder scientific progress. I disagree strongly. Hearing about and experiencing first-hand authorship problems has a chilling effect on one's willingness to enter into collaborations and creates a climate of distrust. Furthermore, it is not difficult to imagine how research integrity, quality, and productivity could be improved if all coauthors participated seriously in the work leading to publication. Anyone who desires authorship should be required to engage in research instead of abusing the reward system by holding the legitimate work of others hostage in exchange for reagents, technical advice, patient data, and other ancillary contributions or by using coercive tactics. In addition, tucked away in the minds of those who desire authorship, but who are unwilling to actively participate in the work, could be useful ideas and insights that might actually enhance an investigation or help to establish new lines of research. Finally, the harm that fraudulent papers of people like Darsee, Slutsky, and Hwang have on their fields and on the trust in and respect of science might be prevented or at least reduced if all coauthors were held to high standards of authorship responsibility. Even with the establishment of well-defined authorship guidelines and mechanisms for resolving and preventing problems though, authorship abuse will still occur. Acquiring something of value is always going to be subject to unscrupulous and opportunistic behavior. However, ignoring or tolerating authorship abuse is unacceptable and dishonest. We owe it to our profession, our trainees, and the people who support our research to work diligently to ensure that authorship on scientific papers reflects the truthful distribution of credit and responsibility for the work. Those who clamor inappropriately for scientific recognition, whether out of a sense of desperation and/or because of bloated and overwrought egos, would do our profession a valuable service by following the advice articulated clearly in a recent Nature editorial entitled \"Ethics and fraud\" (40): \". . . no one should argue ever again that . . . promiscuous authorship on scientific papers . . . can be tolerated . . .

  {"id":"Strike2003","abstract":"There is growing evidence that psychosocial stress can influence the natural history of coronary heart disease.1 Epidemiological studies indicate that psychosocial factors both contribute to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), and increase risk of cardiac dysfunction and the likelihood of cardiac events in susceptible patients with established disease.2,3 An important method of assessing effects on cardiac function is by measuring transient ischaemic responses to standardized mental stress tests. Mental stress-induced myocardial ischaemia (MSIMI) is analogous to exercise stress ischaemia, except that the stimulus is psychological rather than physical. MSIMI has been studied with a number of different imaging techniques and with a range of stressful stimuli. But several investigations have involved small numbers of patients, and the medication status of patients has been variable. This has resulted in diverse findings concerning the prevalence of MSIMI, the conditions in which it is elicited, the type of patients who are most susceptible, the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon, and its clinical significance. In an effort to clarify these issues, we have conducted a systematic review of studies in which myocardial ischaemic responses have been measured in response to standardized mental stressors in the laboratory and clinic. Relevant articles were identified from searches of PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)between 1980 and 2002. Only articles in English language peer-reviewed publications were examined. We included studies that examined the link between standardized mental stress tests and myocardial ischaemic responses. Studies involving patients with CAD and healthy volunteers or patients without CAD were included. To ensure comprehensive data location, further searches were made for authors published in this field and review articles were used as sources.

  {"id":"Sullivan2018a","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To investigate sex-specific vascular mechanisms for mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). APPROACH AND RESULTS Baseline data from a prospective cohort study of 678 patients with coronary artery disease underwent myocardial perfusion imaging before and during a public speaking stressor. The rate-pressure product response was calculated as the difference between the maximum value during the speech minus the minimum value during rest. Peripheral vasoconstriction by peripheral arterial tonometry was calculated as the ratio of pulse wave amplitude during the speech over the resting baseline; ratios <1 indicate a vasoconstrictive response. MSIMI was defined as percent of left ventricle that was ischemic and as a dichotomous variable. Men (but not women) with MSIMI had a higher rate-pressure product response than those without MSIMI (6500 versus 4800 mm Hg bpm), whereas women (but not men) with MSIMI had a significantly lower peripheral arterial tonometry ratio than those without MSIMI (0.5 versus 0.8). In adjusted linear regression, each 1000-U increase in rate-pressure product response was associated with 0.32% (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42) increase in inducible ischemia among men, whereas each 0.10-U decrease in peripheral arterial tonometry ratio was associated with 0.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.35) increase in inducible myocardial ischemia among women. Results were independent of conventional stress-induced myocardial ischemia. CONCLUSIONS Women and men have distinct cardiovascular reactivity mechanisms for MSIMI. For women, stress-induced peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress, and not increased hemodynamic workload, is associated with MSIMI, whereas for men, it is the opposite. Future studies should examine these pathways on long-term outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Al Mheid","given":"Ibhar"},{"family":"Wilmot","given":"Kobina"},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Alkhoder","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Isakadze","given":"Nino"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy"},{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik M."},{"family":"Kutner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Ernest V."},{"family":"Nye","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Puja K."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Tené T."},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

In vivo T2* MR imaging and postmortem assays were used for quantification of secondary brain hemorrhage. In our protocol, 12 thrombin-induced autologous blood clots are injected into the internal carotid artery. No spontaneous reperfusion occurs in the first 24 hours. However, injection of rt-PA 2 or 4 h thereafter, leads to reperfusion of the MCA territory consistent infarcts, increased blood-brain barrier permeability and secondary hemorrhage. Remarkably, clinically important factors known to affect the extent and likelihood of secondary hemorrhage such as hypertension and delayed onset of thrombolysis also increase hematoma size in the model. Thus, the model may serve to investigate the pathophysiology of thrombolysis-induced hemorrhage in thromboembolic ischemia as well as potential adjunctive therapies to prevent this complication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Heiland","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Marti","given":"Hugo H"},{"family":"Veltkamp","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"sun2010","container-title":"Brain Research","container-title-short":"Brain Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.067","ISSN":"1872-6240","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",10,22]]},"PMID":"20974110","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"A translationally relevant thromboembolic stroke model for the study of secondary hemorrhage after thrombolysis in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/20974110"},

  {"id":"Swerdlow2011","abstract":"Background-T-wave alternans (TWA) increases before ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF), suggesting that it may warn of VT/VF in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. Recently, we described a method for measuring alternans and nonalternans variability (TWA/V) from electrograms (EGMs) stored in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators before VT/VF. The goal of this prospective, multicenter study was to determine whether EGM TWA/V was greater before VT/VF than at baseline. Methods and Results-We enrolled 63 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients. TWA/V was computed from stored EGMs before spontaneous VT/VF and from sequential windows of 8 pairs of beats using 4 different control recordings: baseline rhythm, rapid pacing at 105 bpm, segments of ambulatory Holter EGMs matched to the time of VT/VF episodes, and EGMs before spontaneous supraventricular tachycardia. During follow-up, 28 patients had 166 episodes of VT/VF. TWA/V was greater before VT/VF (62.9±3.1 μV; n=28) than during baseline rhythm (12.8±1.8 μV; P<0.0001; n=62), during rapid pacing (14.5±2.0 μV; P<0.0001; n=52), before supraventricular tachycardia (27.5±6.1 μV; P<0.0001; n=9), or during time-matched ambulatory controls (12.3±3.5 μV; P<0.0001; n=16). By logistic regression, the odds of VT/VF increased by a factor of 2.2 for each 10-μV increment in TWA/V (P<0.0001). Conclusions-In implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients, EGM TWA/V is greater before spontaneous VT/VF than in control recordings.

  {"id":"Swerdlow2020","abstract":"Impedance is the ratio of voltage to current in an electrical circuit. Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices measure impedance to assess the structural integrity electrical performance of leads, typically using subthreshold pulses. We review determinants of impedance, how it is measured, variation in clinically measured pacing and high-voltage impedance and impedance trends as a diagnostic for lead failure and lead-device connection problems. We consider the differential diagnosis of abnormal impedance and the approach to the challenging problem of a single, abnormal impedance measurement. Present impedance provides a specific but insensitive diagnostic. For pacing circuits, we review the complementary roles of impedance and more sensitive oversensing diagnostics. Shock circuits lack a sensitive diagnostic. This deficiency is particularly important for insulation breaches, which may go undetected and present with short circuits during therapeutic shocks. We consider new methods for measuring impedance that may increase sensitivity for insulation breaches.","author":[{"family":"Swerdlow","given":"Charles D."},{"family":"Koneru","given":"Jayanthi N."},{"family":"Gunderson","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Kroll","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Ploux","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Ellenbogen","given":"Kenneth A."}],"citation-key":"Swerdlow2020","container-title":"Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCEP.119.008092","ISSN":"19413084","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"page":"172-186","PMID":"31985260","title":"Impedance in the Diagnosis of Lead Malfunction","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Taggart2011a","abstract":"This review examines current knowledge of the effects of higher brain centres and autonomic control loops on the heart with particular relevance to arrhythmogenesis. There is now substantial evidence that higher brain function (cortex), the brain stem and autonomic nerves affect cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia, and that these may function as an interactive system. The roles of mental stress and emotion in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death are no longer confined to the realms of anecdote. Advances in molecular cardiology have identified cardiac cellular ion channel mutations conferring vulnerability to arrhythmic death at the myocardial level. Indeed, specific channelopathies such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome are selectively sensitive to either sympathetic or vagal stimulation. There is increasing evidence that afferent feedback from the heart to the higher centres may affect efferent input to the heart and modulate the cardiac electrophysiology. The new era of functional neuroimaging has identified the central neural circuitry in this brain-heart axis. Since precipitants of sudden fatal arrhythmia are frequently environmental and behavioural, central pathways translating stress into autonomic effects on the heart might be considered as therapeutic targets. These brain-heart interactions help explain the apparent randomness of sudden cardiac events and provide new insights into future novel therapies to prevent sudden death.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Taggart","given":"P"},{"family":"Critchley","given":"H"},{"family":"Lambiase","given":"P D"}],"citation-key":"Taggart2011a","container-title":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/hrt.2010.209304","ISBN":"1468-201X (Electronic)\\r1355-6037 (Linking)","ISSN":"1355-6037","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,1]]},"page":"698-708","PMID":"21367742","title":"Heart-brain interactions in cardiac arrhythmia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://heart.bmj.com/","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"tai-seale2007","abstract":"Objectives To use an innovative videotape analysis method to examine how clinic time was spent during elderly patients' visits to primary care physicians. Secondary objectives were to identify the factors that influence time allocations. Data Sources A convenience sample of 392 videotapes of routine office visits conducted between 1998 and 2000 from multiple primary care practices in the United States, supplemented by patient and physician surveys. Research Design Videotaped visits were examined for visit length and time devoted to specific topics-a novel approach to study time allocation. A survival analysis model analyzed the effects of patient, physician, and physician practice setting on how clinic time was spent. Principal Findings Very limited amount of time was dedicated to specific topics in office visits. The median visit length was 15.7 minutes covering a median of six topics. About 5 minutes were spent on the longest topic whereas the remaining topics each received 1.1 minutes. While time spent by patient and physician on a topic responded to many factors, length of the visit overall varied little even when contents of visits varied widely. Macro factors associated with each site had more influence on visit and topic length than the nature of the problem patients presented. Conclusions Many topics compete for visit time, resulting in small amount of time being spent on each topic. A highly regimented schedule might interfere with having sufficient time for patients with complex or multiple problems. Efforts to improve the quality of care need to recognize the time pressure on both patients and physicians, the effects of financial incentives, and the time costs of improving patient-physician interactions.","author":[{"family":"Tai-Seale","given":"M."},{"family":"McGuire","given":"T.

  {"id":"Takahira2021","abstract":"Background: It is unclear whether there is any difference in the background and prognosis between non-elderly patients who undergo catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) and common atrial flutter (CAFL). Purpose: To investigate the difference between the patient background of both CAFL and AF in the non-elderly. Methods: In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. Results: In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). In 161 patients excluding OHD (Cohort 2), ECG abnormalities were more frequent in AFL than in AF patients (78.3% vs. 39.1%, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. On the other hand, the number of cases that required a pacemaker was significantly higher in the CAFL group than AF group (0.0% vs. 26.1%, p-value <0.001). These results suggested that CAFL may reflect occurrence of any atrial myocardial damage, even if it does not lead to heart failure. Conclusions: Our present study suggested that CAFL may be associated with a broader atrial myocardial disorder in non-elderly patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Takahira","given":"Haruhiro"},{"family":"Kajiyama","given":"Takatsugu"},{"family":"Kondo","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Nakano","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Nakano","given":"Miyo"},{"family":"Ito","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Kitagawa","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Sugawara","given":"Masafumi"},{"family":"Chiba","given":"Toshinori"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Yoshio"}],"citation-key":"Takahira2021","container-title":"Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.05.008","ISSN":"18764738","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"362-367","PMID":"34140202","title":"Pathophysiological background and prognosis of common atrial flutter in non-elderly patients: Comparison to Atrial Fibrillation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2021.05.008","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"takayama2020","abstract":"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates tissue homeostasis and remodelling through antagonistic effects of noradrenergic sympathetic and cholinergic parasympathetic signalling. Despite numerous reports on the induction of sympathetic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), no induction methods have effectively derived cholinergic parasympathetic neurons from hPSCs. Considering the antagonistic effects of noradrenergic and cholinergic inputs on target organs, both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons are expected to be induced. This study aimed to develop a stepwise chemical induction method to induce sympathetic-like and parasympathetic-like ANS neurons. Autonomic specification was achieved through restricting signals inducing sensory or enteric neurogenesis and activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals. Global mRNA expression analyses after stepwise induction, including single-cell RNA-seq analysis of induced neurons and functional assays revealed that each induced sympathetic-like or parasympathetic-like neuron acquired pharmacological and electrophysiological functional properties with distinct marker expression. Further, we identified selective induction methods using appropriate seeding cell densities and neurotrophic factor concentrations. Neurons were individually induced, facilitating the regulation of the beating rates of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in an antagonistic manner. The induction methods yield specific neuron types, and their influence on various tissues can be studied by co-cultured assays.","author":[{"family":"Takayama","given":"Yuzo"},{"family":"Kushige","given":"Hiroko"},{"family":"Akagi","given":"Yuka"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Kumagai","given":"Yutaro"},{"family":"Kida","given":"Yasuyuki S."}],"citation-key":"takayama2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-66303-3","ISSN":"20452322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"PMID":"32528170","publisher":"Nature Research","title":"Selective Induction of Human Autonomic Neurons Enables Precise Control of Cardiomyocyte Beating","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

This study aimed to elucidate the incidences of AF recurrence and of progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF, after CA, in patients with paroxysmal AF.\n\nMethods and Results—\n\nWe examined the incidence of AF recurrence and AF progression in 1220 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years), with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, undergoing CA, based on extensive pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation for nonpulmonary vein foci. AF recurrence–free survival probabilities at 5 years were 59.4% after the initial CA and 81.1% after the final CA (average, 1.3 procedures). During a median follow-up period of 47.9 (range, 5.3–123.3) months after the initial CA, AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent in 15 (1.2%) patients (0.3%/y). The duration of AF history (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P<0.0001), number of ineffective antiarrhythmics (HR, 1.09; P=0.005), and left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area (HR, 1.05; P=0.001) were significant predictors of AF recurrence.

  {"id":"Takiguchi2017","abstract":"Objective Pulmonary nocardiosis frequently develops as an opportunistic infection in patients with malig-nant tumor and is treated with steroids. This study was performed to clarify the clinical features of pulmonary nocardiosis in Japan. Methods The patients definitively diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis at our hospital between January 1995 and December 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Results Nineteen men and 11 women (30 in total) were diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Almost all patients were complicated by a non-pulmonary underlying disease, such as malignant tumor or collagen vas-cular disease, or pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial pneumonia, and 13 patients (43.3%) were treated with steroids or immunosuppressors. Gram staining was performed in 29 patients, and a characteristic Gram-positive rod was detected in 28 patients (96.6%). Thirty-one strains of Nocardia were isolated and identified. Seven strains of Nocardia farcinica were isolated as the most frequent species, followed by Nocardia nova isolated from 6 patients. Seventeen patients died, giving a crude morality rate of 56.7% and a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%. The 1-year survival rates in the groups with and without immunosuppressant agents were 41.7% and 59.7%, respectively, showing that the outcome of those receiving immunosuppressants tended to be poorer than those not receiving them. Conclusion Pulmonary nocardiosis developed as an opportunistic infection in most cases. The outcome was relatively poor, with a 1-year survival rate of 55.4%, and it was particularly poor in patients treated with im-munosuppressant agents. Pulmonary nocardiosis should always be considered in patients presenting with an opportunistic respiratory infection, and an early diagnosis requires sample collection and Gram staining.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Takiguchi","given":"Yasuo"},{"family":"Ishizaki","given":"Shunsuke"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Takayuki"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Shun"},{"family":"Hashimoto","given":"Yaeko"},{"family":"Suruga","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Akiba","given":"Yoko"}],"citation-key":"Takiguchi2017","container-title":"Intern Med","DOI":"10.2169/internalmedicine.56.8163","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1485-1490","title":"Pulmonary Nocardiosis: A Clinical Analysis of 30 Cases","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

Baseline characteristics and heart failure related clinical outcomes (death, LVAD) were obtained at 12 months. Correlation between clinical endpoints and the following variables were analyzed: ejection fraction (EF), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), NYHA class, renal function, Doppler cardiac output (CO), and LVOT VTI. Study cohort consisted of 100 patients. At the 12-month follow up period, 30 events (28 deaths, 2 LVADs) were identified.

Experimental evidence for an associ- ation between a propensity for lethal arrhythmias and signs of either increased sympathetic or reduced vagal activity has encouraged the development of quantitative markers of autonomic activity. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising such markers. The apparently easy derivation of this measure has popularized its use. As many commercial devices now provide automated measurement of HRV, the cardiologist has been pro- vided with a seemingly simple tool for both research and clinical studies[5].

  {"id":"Tassaux2005","abstract":"RATIONALE: During pressure-support ventilation, the ventilator cycles into expiration when inspiratory flow decreases to a given percentage of peak inspiratory flow (\"expiratory trigger\"). In obstructive disease, the slower rise and decrease of inspiratory flow entails delayed cycling, an increase in intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and nontriggering breaths. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that setting expiratory trigger at a higher than usual percentage of peak inspiratory flow would attenuate the adverse effects of delayed cycling. METHODS: Ten intubated patients with obstructive disease undergoing pressure support were studied at expiratory trigger settings of 10, 25, 50, and 70% of peak inspiratory flow. MEASUREMENTS: Continuous recording of diaphragmatic EMG activity with surface electrodes, and esophageal and gastric pressures with a dual-balloon nasogastric tube. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with expiratory trigger 10, expiratory trigger 70 reduced the magnitude of delayed cycling (0.25 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.72 s, p < 0.05), intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 cm H(2)O, p < 0.05), nontriggering breaths (2 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 5 breaths/min, p < 0.05), and triggering pressure-time product (0.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.7 cm H2O . s, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Setting expiratory trigger at a higher percentage of peak inspiratory flow in patients with obstructive disease during pressure support improves patient-ventilator synchrony and reduces inspiratory muscle effort. Further studies should explore whether these effects can influence patient outcome.","author":[{"family":"Tassaux","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Gainnier","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Battisti","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Jolliet","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Tassaux2005","container-title":"American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine","DOI":"10.1164/rccm.200407-880OC","ISBN":"1073-449X (Print)\\r1073-449X (Linking)","ISSN":"1073449X","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"1283-1289","PMID":"16109983","title":"Impact of expiratory trigger setting on delayed cycling and inspiratory muscle workload","type":"article-journal","volume":"172"},

We imaged the amygdala, a brain region involved in stress, to determine whether its resting metabolic activity predicts risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. Methods Individuals aged 30 years or older without known cardiovascular disease or active cancer disorders, who underwent 18F-fluorodexoyglucose PET/CT at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008, were studied longitudinally. Amygdalar activity, bone-marrow activity, and arterial inflammation were assessed with validated methods. In a separate cross-sectional study we analysed the relation between perceived stress, amygdalar activity, arterial inflammation, and C-reactive protein. Image analyses and cardiovascular disease event adjudication were done by mutually blinded researchers. Relations between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events were assessed with Cox models, log-rank tests, and mediation (path) analyses. Findings 293 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 45·0–65·5]) were included in the longitudinal study, 22 of whom had a cardiovascular disease event during median follow-up of 3·7 years (IQR 2·7–4·8). Amygdalar activity was associated with increased bone-marrow activity (r=0·47; p<0·0001), arterial inflammation (r=0·49; p<0·0001), and risk of cardiovascular disease events (standardised hazard ratio 1·59, 95% CI 1·27–1·98; p<0·0001), a finding that remained significant after multivariate adjustments. The association between amygdalar activity and cardiovascular disease events seemed to be mediated by increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation in series. In the separate cross-sectional study of patients who underwent psychometric analysis (n=13), amygdalar activity was significantly associated with arterial inflammation (r=0·70; p=0·0083). Perceived stress was associated with amygdalar activity (r=0·56; p=0·0485), arterial inflammation (r=0·59; p=0·0345), and C-reactive protein (r=0·83; p=0·0210). Interpretation In this first study to link regional brain activity to subsequent cardiovascular disease, amygdalar activity independently and robustly predicted cardiovascular disease events. Amygdalar activity is involved partly via a path that includes increased bone-marrow activity and arterial inflammation. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism through which emotional stressors can lead to cardiovascular disease in human beings.

The physiological basis for such oscillations is unclear. In our study, we used blocking drugs to evaluate potential contributions of sympathetic and vagal mechanisms and the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system to very-low-frequency RR-interval variability in 10 young healthy subjects. Methods and Results-We recorded RR intervals and arterial pressures during three separate sessions, with the patient in supine and 40 degree upright tilt positions, during 20-minute frequency (0.25 Hz) and tidal volume-controlled breathing after intravenous injections: saline (control), atenolol (0.2 mg/kg, β-adrenergic blockade), atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg, parasympathetic blockade), atenolol and atropine (complete autonomic blockade), and enalaprilat (0.02 mg/kg, ACE blockade). We integrated fast Fourier transform RR-interval spectral power at very low (0.003 to 0.03 Hz), low (0.05 to 0.15 Hz), and respiratory (0.2 to 0.3 Hz) frequencies. β- Adrenergic blockade had no significant effect on very-low-or low-frequency RR-interval power but increased respiratory frequency power 2-fold. ACE blockade had no significant effect on low or respiratory frequency RR- interval power but modestly (~ 21.%) increased very-low-frequency power in the supine (but not upright tilt) position (P<0.05). The most profound effects were exerted by parasympathetic blockade: Atropine, given alone or with atenolol, abolished nearly all RR-interval variability and decreased very-low-frequency variability by 92%. Conclusions-Although very-low- frequency heart period rhythms are influenced by the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, as low and respiratory frequency RR-interval rhythms, they depend primarily on the presence of parasympathetic outflow. Therefore the prognostic value of very-low-frequency heart period oscillations may derive from the fundamental importance of parasympathetic mechanisms in cardiovascular health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"J.

  {"id":"Taylor2011","abstract":"Diminished baroreflex sensitivity in the morning negatively influences morning coronary blood flow and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. Our aim was to determine the contribution of the mechanical and neural components of the cardiac baroreflex to diurnal variation in blood pressure control. In 12 healthy participants, we used the modified Oxford method to quantify baroreflex sensitivity for rising (G(up)) and falling (G(down)) pressures in the morning (7:00 am) and afternoon (4:00 pm). Beat-to-beat blood pressure, R-R intervals, and carotid artery diameter measurements were recorded. Integrated sensitivity was determined by plotting R-R intervals against systolic blood pressure. The mechanical component was carotid artery diameter plotted against systolic blood pressure, and the neural component was R-R intervals plotted against carotid artery diameter. Linear mixed models were used to compare the integrated, mechanical, and neural sensitivities between morning and afternoon. We found significant diurnal variation in integrated sensitivity, with an attenuated response in the morning (G(up)=13.0±0.6; G(down)=6.3±0.4 ms/mm Hg) when compared with the afternoon (G(up)=15.1±0.6; G(down)=12.6±0.4 ms/mm Hg). For rising pressures, the diminished integrated sensitivity in the morning was caused by a reduction in mechanical sensitivity, whereas for falling pressures it was caused by a reduction in neural sensitivity. Our findings explicate the mechanisms underlying diurnal variation in baroreflex function. Pharmacological and lifestyle interventions targeted specifically at the diminished component of the cardiac baroreflex in the morning may lead to better management of hypertension.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Chloe E."},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Willie","given":"Christopher K."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Ainslie","given":"Philip N."},{"family":"Tzeng","given":"Yu Chieh"}],"citation-key":"Taylor2011","container-title":"Hypertension","DOI":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.171512","ISBN":"1524-4563 (Electronic)\\r0194-911X (Linking)","ISSN":"0194911X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"51-56","PMID":"21632473","title":"Diurnal variation in the mechanical and neural components of the baroreflex","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ahajournals.org","volume":"58"},
  {"id":"Taylor2022","abstract":"Mammals show clear changes in heart rate linked to lung ventilation, characterized as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). These changes are controlled in part by variations in the level of inhibitory control exerted on the heart by the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system (PNS). This originates from preganglionic neurons in the nucleus ambiguous that supply phasic, respiration-related activity to the cardiac branch of the vagus nerve, via myelinated, efferent fibres with rapid conduction velocities. An elaboration of these central mechanisms, under the control of a ‘vagal system’ has been endowed by psychologists with multiple functions concerned with ‘social engagement’ in mammals and, in particular, humans. Long-term study of cardiorespiratory interactions (CRI) in other major groups of vertebrates has established that they all show both tonic and phasic control of heart rate, imposed by the PNS. This derives centrally from neurones located in variously distributed nuclei, supplying the heart via fast-conducting, myelinated, efferent fibres. Water-breathing vertebrates, which include fishes and larval amphibians, typically show direct, 1:1 CRI between heart beats and gill ventilation, controlled from the dorsal vagal motor nucleus. In air-breathing, ectothermic vertebrates, including reptiles, amphibians and lungfish, CRI mirroring RSA have been shown to improve oxygen uptake during phasic ventilation by changes in perfusion of their respiratory organs, due to shunting of blood over across their undivided hearts. This system may constitute the evolutionary basis of that generating RSA in mammals, which now lacks a major physiological role in respiratory gas exchange, due to their completely divided systemic and pulmonary circulations.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Edwin W."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Leite","given":"Cleo A.C."}],"citation-key":"Taylor2022","container-title":"Biological Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsycho.2022.108382","ISSN":"18736246","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"PMID":"35777519","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"An overview of the phylogeny of cardiorespiratory control in vertebrates with some reflections on the ‘Polyvagal Theory’","type":"article-journal","volume":"172"},

Objectives This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of OM in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Methods Patients admitted for AHF with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, dyspnea, and elevated plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides were randomized to receive a double-blind, 48-h intravenous infusion of placebo or OM in 3 sequential, escalating-dose cohorts. Results In 606 patients, OM did not improve the primary endpoint of dyspnea relief (3 OM dose groups and pooled placebo: placebo, 41%; OM cohort 1, 42%; cohort 2, 47%; cohort 3, 51%; p = 0.33) or any of the secondary outcomes studied. In supplemental, pre-specified analyses, OM resulted in greater dyspnea relief at 48 h (placebo, 37% vs. OM, 51%; p = 0.034) and through 5 days (p = 0.038) in the high-dose cohort. OM exerted plasma concentration-related increases in left ventricular systolic ejection time (p < 0.0001) and decreases in end-systolic dimension (p < 0.05). The adverse event profile and tolerability of OM were similar to those of placebo, without increases in ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Plasma troponin concentrations were higher in OM-treated patients compared with placebo (median difference at 48 h, 0.004 ng/ml), but with no obvious relationship with OM concentration (p = 0.95). Conclusions In patients with AHF, intravenous OM did not meet the primary endpoint of dyspnea improvement, but it was generally well tolerated, it increased systolic ejection time, and it may have improved dyspnea in the high-dose group.

The GALACTIC-HF (Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure) trial tests the hypotheses that omecamtiv mecarbil can safely improve symptoms, prevent clinical HF events, and delay CV death in patients with chronic HF. The GALACTIC-HF trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. More than 8,000 patients with chronic symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) HF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, elevated natriuretic peptides, and either current hospitalization for HF or history of hospitalization or emergency department visit for HF within a year of screening will be randomized to either oral placebo or omecamtiv mecarbil employing a pharmacokinetic-guided dose titration strategy using doses of 25, 37.5, or 50 mg twice daily.

  {"id":"Tereshchenko2011","abstract":"Objective: We proposed and tested a novel electrocardiogram marker of risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). Methods: Digital orthogonal electrocardiograms were recorded at rest before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in 508 participants of a primary prevention ICDs prospective cohort study (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 12 years; 377 male [74%]). The sum magnitude of the absolute QRST integral in 3 orthogonal leads (SAI QRST) was calculated. A derivation cohort of 128 patients was used to define a cutoff; a validation cohort (n = 380) was used to test a predictive value. Results: During a mean follow-up of 18 months, 58 patients received appropriate ICD therapies. The SAI QRST was lower in patients with VA (105.2 ± 60.1 vs 138.4 ± 85.7 mV - ms, P = .002). In the Cox proportional hazards analysis, patients with SAI QRST not exceeding 145 mV - ms had about 4-fold higher risk of VA (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.96-6.71; P < .0001) and a 6-fold higher risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (hazard ratio, 6.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-29.69; P = .014), whereas prediction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation did not reach statistical significance.

We hypothesized that a genomewide association study would identify genetic loci related to GEH. Methods and Results--We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near TBX3) was associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95% CI 0.13-0.19]; P=1.5×10 -26 ), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14]; P=2.1×10 -12 ), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95% CI -0.15 to -0.09]; P=5.9×10 -15 ). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1% to 1.6% of GEH variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near HMCN2), 5 (IGF1R), 11 (11p11.2 region cluster), and 7 (near ACTB) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci.

To identify genetic variants associated with each of the five dimensions of personality we performed a genome-wide association (GWA) scan of 3972 individuals from a genetically isolated population within Sardinia, Italy. On the basis of the analyses of 362 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms we found several strong signals within or near genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders.

  {"id":"Thakur1996","abstract":"Background: Idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (ILVT) characterized by QRS complexes with right bundle-branch block (RBBB) morphology and left axis deviation is a distinct clinical syndrome that also demonstrates a characteristic response to verapamil and inducibility from the atrium in patients without structural heart disease. A false tendon has been described in the left ventricle in a patient with ILVT in whom surgical resection of the false tendon resulted in cure. We hypothesized that the false tendon is responsible for the genesis of similar ventricular tachycardia (VT) in others. Methods and Results: We performed transthoracic (TTE) and/or transesophageal (TEE) two-dimensional echocardiograms in 15 patients undergoing catheter ablation for ILVT. There were 12 men and 3 women (mean age, 31 ± 12 years, with average symptom duration of 11 ± 9 years). The mean VT cycle length was 36 ± 70 ms, and all had RBBB morphology with left axis deviation. Cardiac chamber sizes, left ventricular wall thickness, and wall motion were normal in all ILVT patients. TTE and/or TEE demonstrated a false tendon extending from the posteroinferior left ventricular free wall to the left ventricular septum in all ILVT patients. The false tendons were thick (≥2 mm maximal thickness) in 5 patients and thin (<2 mm maximal thickness) in 10 patients. We compared ILVT patients with a control group of 671 consecutive patients referred for echocardiography for other reasons. The mean age for the control group was 42 years. A false tendon was seen in the left ventricle in 34 of 671 (5%). In the control group patients with a false tendon, 2 patients had a history of VT (left bundle-branch block morphology) and 1 had ventricular fibrillation. The false tendons in the control patients were also oriented transversely across the ventricular cavity but were somewhat thinner (<2 mm maximal thickness in 32 of 34 patients). Catheter ablation with the use of radiofrequency and/or direct current applied to the posteroapical septum resulted in cure in 14 of 15 patients. Conclusions: A false tendon extending from the posteroinferior left ventricle to the septum is a consistent finding in patients with ILVT and probably is responsible for this unique arrhythmia. The mechanism by which the false tendon precipitates tachycardia is speculative, but possibilities include conduction through the false tendon or by producing stretch in the Purkinje fiber network on the interventricular septum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Thakur","given":"Ranjan K."},{"family":"Klein","given":"George J."},{"family":"Sivaram","given":"Chittur A."},{"family":"Zardini","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Schleinkofer","given":"David E."},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Yee","given":"Raymond"},{"family":"Jackman","given":"Warren M."}],"citation-key":"Thakur1996","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/01.CIR.93.3.497","ISSN":"00097322","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",2,1]]},"page":"497-501","PMID":"8565167","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","title":"Anatomic substrate for idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.cir.93.3.497","volume":"93"},

Activation of vagal afferents results in sympathoinhibitory, cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor responses. Cardiac sympathetic afferents activated during myocardial ischaemia mediate sympathoexcitatory, vasoconstrictor cardioaccelerator responses. 3. The focus of the present review is on the activation of sympathetic afferents by myocardial ischaemia and on the resulting reflex responses that they mediate. 4. These endings are more likely to be activated as the degree of ischaemia progresses from subendocardial towards transmural. They are evenly distributed between the anterior and inferoposterior wall. Although it has been suggested that these endings are activated by bradykinin, recent evidence indicates that they are activated by adenosine released from the ischaemic myocardium. Results from our laboratory indicate that this effect is due to the activation of adenosine A1, but not adenosine A2 receptors. 5.

We will emphasize the relationship between attentional regulation and affective processes and propose a group of underlying physiological systems that serve to integrate these functions in the service of self-regulation and adaptability of the organism. We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms.","author":[{"family":"Thayer","given":"Julian F"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Richard D"}],"citation-key":"thayer2000","collection-title":"Arousal in Anxiety","container-title":"Journal of Affective Disorders","container-title-short":"Journal of Affective Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00338-4","ISSN":"0165-0327","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",12,2]]},"page":"201-216","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A model of neurovisceral integration in emotion regulation and dysregulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032700003384","volume":"61"},

We review a number of studies from our group showing that individual differences in HRV are related to performance on tasks associated with executive function and prefrontal cortical activity. These studies include comparisons of executive- and nonexecutive-function tasks in healthy participants, in both threatening and nonthreatening conditions. In addition, we show that manipulating resting HRV levels is associated with changes in performance on executive-function tasks. We also examine the relationship between HRV and cognitive performance in ecologically valid situations using a police shooting simulation and a naval navigation simulation. Finally, we review our studies in anxiety patients, as well as studies examining psychopathy.

  {"id":"Thayer2012","abstract":"The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly ‘top–down’ appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in ‘appraisal’ systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, HRV may serve as a proxy for ‘vertical integration’ of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Thayer","given":"Julian F."},{"family":"Åhs","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Fredrikson","given":"Mats"},{"family":"Sollers","given":"John J."},{"family":"Wager","given":"Tor D."}],"citation-key":"Thayer2012","container-title":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.009","ISSN":"0149-7634","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"page":"747-756","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A meta-analysis of heart rate variability and neuroimaging studies: Implications for heart rate variability as a marker of stress and health","title-short":"A meta-analysis of heart rate variability and neuroimaging studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763411002077","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"Thomas2019","abstract":"Introduction: Subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF), in the form of cardiac implantable device-detected atrial high rate episodes (AHREs), has been associated with increased thromboembolism. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with a floating atrial dipole may permit a single lead (DX) ICD system to detect AHREs. We sought to assess the utility of the DX ICD system for subclinical AF detection in patients, with a prospective multicenter, cohort-controlled trial. Methods and Results: One hundred fifty patients without prior history of AF (age 59 ± 13 years; 108 [72%] male) were enrolled into the DX cohort and implanted with a Biotronik DX ICD system at eight centers. Age-, sex-, and left ventricular ejection fraction-matched single- and dual-chamber ICD cohorts were derived from a Cornell database and from the IMPACT trial, respectively. The primary endpoint were AHRE detection at 12 months. During median 12 months follow-up, AHREs were detected in 19 (13%) patients in the DX, 8 (5.3%) in the single-chamber, and 19 (13%) in the dual-chamber cohorts. The rate of AHRE detection was significantly higher in the DX cohort compared to the single-chamber cohort (P =.026), but not significantly different compared to the dual-chamber cohort. There were no inappropriate ICD therapies in the DX cohort. At 12 months, only 3.0% of patients in the DX cohort had sensed atrial amplitudes less than 1.0 mV. Conclusion: Use of a DX ICD lead allows subclinical AF detection with a single lead DX system that is superior to that of a conventional single-chamber ICD system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"George"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Daniel Y."},{"family":"Doppalapudi","given":"Harish"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Iwai","given":"Sei"},{"family":"Daoud","given":"Emile G."},{"family":"Houmsse","given":"Mahmoud"},{"family":"Kanagasundram","given":"Arvindh N."},{"family":"Mainigi","given":"Sumeet K."},{"family":"Lubitz","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Jim W."}],"citation-key":"Thomas2019","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/jce.14081","ISSN":"15408167","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"page":"1994-2001","PMID":"31328298","publisher":"J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol","title":"Subclinical atrial fibrillation detection with a floating atrial sensing dipole in single lead implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems: Results of the SENSE trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328298/","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"Thuny2014","abstract":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is among the most severe infectious disease, the prevention of which has not decreased its incidence. The age of patients and the rate of health care-associated IE have increased as a consequence of medical progress. The prevention strategies have been subjected to an important debate and nonspecific hygiene measures are now placed above the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Indeed, the level of evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis efficiency is low and the indications of its prescription have been restricted in the recent international guidelines. In cases carrying a high suspicion of IE, efforts should be made to rapidly identify patients with a definite or highly probable diagnosis of IE and to find the causative pathogen to ensure that appropriate treatment, including urgent valvular surgery, begins promptly. Although echocardiography remains the main accurate imaging modality to identify endocardial lesions associated with IE, it can be negative or inconclusive especially in cases of prosthetic valve or other intracardiac devices. Recent studies demonstrated the diagnostic value of other imaging strategies including cardiac computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/CT, radiolabelled leukocyte single-photon emission CT/CT, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Novel perspectives on the management of endocarditis are emerging and offer a hope for decreasing the rate of residual deaths by accelerating the processes of diagnosis, risk stratification, and instauration of antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, the rapid transfer of high-risk patients to specialized mediosurgical centres (IE team), the development of new surgical modalities, and close long-term follow-up are of crucial importance. © 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.","author":[{"family":"Thuny","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Grisoli","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cautela","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Riberi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Raoult","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Habib","given":"Gilbert"}],"citation-key":"Thuny2014","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cjca.2014.03.042","ISBN":"1916-7075 (Electronic) 0828-282X (Linking)","ISSN":"0828282X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1046-1057","PMID":"25151287","publisher":"Canadian Cardiovascular Society","title":"Infective endocarditis: Prevention, diagnosis, and management","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2014.03.042","volume":"30"},

First, increasing numbers of travelers are older than 60 years of age or are seeking health care elsewhere (\" medical tour-ists \"), and these travelers are more likely than others to have clinically significant coexisting conditions and consequently increased morbidity from infections. Sec-ond, the likelihood of multidrug resistance in the infecting organisms is increas-ing. 5-7 The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the reemergence of Zika and chikungunya viruses have highlighted the importance of being alert to the possi-bility that an emerging pathogen is causing a febrile episode.

Our results, from two independent cohorts of Finnish prisoners, revealed that a monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) low-activity genotype (contributing to low dopamine turnover rate) as well as the CDH13 gene (coding for neuronal membrane adhesion protein) are associated with extremely violent behavior (at least 10 committed homicides, attempted homicides or batteries). No substantial signal was observed for either MAOA or CDH13 among non-violent offenders, indicating that findings were specific for violent offending, and not largely attributable to substance abuse or antisocial personality disorder. These results indicate both low monoamine metabolism and neuronal membrane dysfunction as plausible factors in the etiology of extreme criminal violent behavior, and imply that at least about 5-10% of all severe violent crime in Finland is attributable to the aforementioned MAOA and CDH13 genotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Tiihonen","given":"J"},{"family":"Rautiainen","given":"M.

  {"id":"Tijdink2014","abstract":"PURPOSE: To determine content validity, structural validity, construct validity and reliability of an internet-based questionnaire designed for assessment of publication pressure experienced by medical scientists. METHODS: The Publication Pressure Questionnaire (PPQ) was designed to assess psychological pressure to publish scientific papers. Content validity was evaluated by collecting independent comments from external experts (n = 7) on the construct, comprehensiveness and relevance of the PPQ. Structural validity was assessed by factor analysis and item response theory (IRT) using the generalized partial credit model. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess potential correlations with the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Single test reliability (lambda2) was obtained from the IRT analysis. RESULTS: Content validity was satisfactory. Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the presence of three initially assumed separate domains of publication pressure (i.e., personally experienced publication pressure, publication pressure in general, pressure on position of scientist). After exclusion of the third domain (six items), we performed exploratory factor analysis and IRT. The goodness-of-fit statistics for the IRT assuming a single dimension were satisfactory when four items were removed, resulting in 14 items of the final PPQ. Correlations with the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scales of the MBI were 0.34 and 0.31, respectively, supporting construct validity. Single test administration reliability lambda2 was 0.69 and 0.90 on the test scores and expected a posteriori scores, respectively. CONCLUSION: The PPQ seems a valid and reliable instrument to measure publication pressure among medical scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Tijdink","given":"J.

  {"id":"Tilak2015","abstract":"The number of authors per manuscript in peer-reviewed medical journals has increased substantially in the last several decades. Several reasons have been offered to explain this authorship growth, including increased researcher collaboration, honorary authorship driven by increased pressures for funding and promotion, the belief that including senior authors will facilitate publication, and the growing complexity of medical research. It is unknown, however, whether authorship has grown over time due to growing complexity of published academic articles, in which case growth could be warranted, or whether it has grown due to pressures of funding and academic promotion, which have created \"authorship inflation.\" To answer this question, we analyzed data on authorship count, study type, and size of study population for the first 50 original articles published in each decade during 1960-2010 in 3 major medical journals. Within each type of study we considered (eg, randomized trials, observational studies, etc), average authorship rose more than 3-fold during this period. Similar growth persisted after adjustment for changes in study population sizes over time. Our findings suggest that increasing research complexity is an inadequate explanation for authorship growth.

  {"id":"Tison2019b","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The ECG remains the most widely used diagnostic test for characterization of cardiac structure and electrical activity. We hypothesized that parallel advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms, and availability of large-scale data could substantially expand the clinical inferences derived from the ECG while at the same time preserving interpretability for medical decision-making. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6% for heart rate and 4% for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16% and 19%, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits. Model performance using our approach for disease detection demonstrated areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 0.91 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 0.86 for cardiac amyloid, and 0.77 for mitral valve prolapse. CONCLUSIONS: Modern machine learning methods can extend the 12-lead ECG to quantitative applications well beyond its current uses while preserving the transparency that is so fundamental to clinical care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Tison","given":"Geoffrey H."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Delling","given":"Francesca N."},{"family":"Deo","given":"Rahul C."}],"citation-key":"Tison2019b","container-title":"Circulation.

  {"id":"Toouli1989","abstract":"Ever since its description approximately 100 years ago, the sphincter of Oddi has been surrounded by controversy. First, whether it indeed existed, second, whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the manometry, we have subdivided the dysfunction into two groups; a group characterised by a stenotic pattern - that is, raised sphincter basal pressure - and a second group having a dyskinetic pattern - that is, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin injection, rapid contraction frequency, high percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal pressure. It is apparent from the mamometry but also from the clinical data that the patients are a heterogeneous group and thus any therapy would need to be tailored for each patient and abnormality. The most recent therapeutic data suggest that patients with the stenotic pattern on manometry respond to division of the sphincter, however, those patients with the dyskinetic manometric pattern show no significant effect after sphincterotomy. Further prospective trials evaluating therapeutic options are under way and their results are eagerly awaited.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Toouli","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"Toouli1989","container-title":"Gut","DOI":"10.1136/gut.30.6.753","ISSN":"00175749","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"page":"753-761","PMID":"2666281","title":"What is sphincter of Oddi dysfunction?","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"Torp-Pedersen1999","abstract":"Background: Atrial fibrillation occurs frequently in patients with congestive heart failure and commonly results in clinical deterioration and hospitalization. Sinus rhythm may be maintained with antiarrhythmic drugs, but some of these drugs increase the risk of death. Methods: We studied 1518 patients-with symptomatic congestive heart failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction at 34 Danish hospitals. We randomly assigned 762 patients to receive dofetilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, and 756 to receive placebo in a double-blind study. Treatment was initiated in the hospital and included three days of cardiac monitoring and dose adjustment. The primary end point was death from any cause. Results: During a median follow-up of 18 months, 311 patients in the dofetilide group (41 percent) and 317 patients in the placebo group (42 percent) died (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.11). Treatment with dofetilide significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure (risk ratio, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.89). Dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. After one month, 22 of 190 patients with atrial fibrillation at base line (12 percent) had sinus rhythm restored with dofetilide, as compared with only 3 of 201 patients (1 percent) given placebo. Once sinus rhythm was restored, dofetilide was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm (hazard ratio for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.57; P<0.001). There were 25 cases of torsade de pointes in the dofetilide group (3.3 percent) as corn pared with none in the placebo group. Conclusions: In patients with congestive heart failure and reduced left ventricular function, dofetilide was effective in converting atrial fibrillation, preventing its recurrence, and reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

  {"id":"Treutlein2017","abstract":"Stress increases the risk for major depressive disorder (MDD), overeating, and alcohol dependence (AD). The neuropeptide Y system is one of the best-known modulators of the stress response, and some of its effects are mediated through the neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R). The functional NPY2R variant rs6857715 (C-599T) has been implicated in both obesity and AD, but with opposing alleles. The present study explored whether rs6857715 is also associated with MDD. Analysis of the overall sample (595 MDD cases; 1295 controls) showed an association with the AD risk allele C [P=0.020, odds ratio (OR) (C-allele)=1.18]. The association remained significant after excluding MDD patients with AD/alcohol abuse [P=0.038, OR (C-allele)=1.18]; increased weight/appetite [P=0.006, OR (C-allele)=1.23]; or both [P=0.008, OR (Callele)= 1.25]. The present findings suggest that the NPY2R rs6857715 C-allele makes a genuine contribution toward MDD.

  {"id":"Tutuko2022","abstract":"Background\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used diagnostic that observes the heart activities of patients to ascertain a heart abnormality diagnosis. The artifacts or noises are primarily associated with the problem of ECG signal processing. Conventional denoising techniques have been proposed in previous literature; however, some lacks, such as the determination of suitable wavelet basis function and threshold, can be a time-consuming process. This paper presents end-to-end learning using a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) for denoising algorithms and convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory (ConvBiLSTM) for ECG delineation to classify ECG waveforms in terms of the PQRST-wave and isoelectric lines. The denoising reconstruction using unsupervised learning based on the encoder-decoder process can be proposed to improve the drawbacks. First, The ECG signals are reduced to a low-dimensional vector in the encoder. Second, the decoder reconstructed the signals. The last, the reconstructed signals of ECG can be processed to ConvBiLSTM. The proposed architecture of DAE-ConvBiLSTM is the end-to-end diagnosis of heart abnormality detection.\n\nResults\nAs a result, the performance of DAE-ConvBiLSTM has obtained an average of above 98.59% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score from the existing studies. The DAE-ConvBiLSTM has also experimented with detecting T-wave (due to ventricular repolarisation) morphology abnormalities.\n\nConclusion\nThe development architecture for detecting heart abnormalities using an unsupervised learning DAE and supervised learning ConvBiLSTM can be proposed for an end-to-end learning algorithm. In the future, the precise accuracy of the ECG main waveform will affect heart abnormalities detection in clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Tutuko","given":"Bambang"},{"family":"Darmawahyuni","given":"Annisa"},{"family":"Nurmaini","given":"Siti"},{"family":"Tondas","given":"Alexander Edo"},{"family":"Naufal Rachmatullah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Teguh","given":"Samuel Benedict Putra"},{"family":"Firdaus","given":"Firdaus"},{"family":"Sapitri","given":"Ade Iriani"},{"family":"Passarella","given":"Rossi"}],"citation-key":"Tutuko2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0277932","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,30]]},"page":"e0277932","PMCID":"PMC9803308","PMID":"36584187","source":"PubMed Central","title":"DAE-ConvBiLSTM: End-to-end learning single-lead electrocardiogram signal for heart abnormalities detection","title-short":"DAE-ConvBiLSTM","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9803308/","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"Uijtdehaage2018","abstract":"Purpose The health professions education (HPE) community is a crossroad of scholars from various disciplines with potentially conflicting views on who qualifies as author. Established HPE scholars are expected to model ethical research conduct, but no research has investigated the extent to which authorship criteria are understood and applied by leaders in the field. This study investigated what leading scholars consider appropriate criteria for authorship and how often these criteria are ignored. Method Directors of research and editors of HPE journals completed an anonymous survey between September 2015 and August 2016 with questions about authorship practices they experienced and recommended, common authorship criteria, and how often they had encountered unethical authorship decisions. Results Out of 82 invited scholars, 46 participated in the survey (response rate = 56.0%). They reported a stark contrast between current and recommended authorship practices. Twenty-two (51.2%) had experienced unethical pressure regarding authorship order, 15 (34.9%) had not been included as author when they qualified, and 25 (58.1%) had seen authors included who did not qualify. A slight majority (n = 25; 58.1%) correctly identified authorship standards widely adopted by biomedical journals. Conclusions A surprising proportion of leaders in the HPE field had encountered unethical authorship practices. Despite widely disseminated authorship criteria, the findings suggest that offering authorship to those who do not qualify, or arguably worse, excluding those who should have been included, remains a common practice. The authors offer strategies to scholars, editors, and tenure and promotion committees to combat these practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Uijtdehaage","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Mavis","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Durning","given":"Steven J."}],"citation-key":"Uijtdehaage2018","container-title":"Academic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/ACM.0000000000002144","ISSN":"1938808X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"page":"1171-1175","PMID":"29384749","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Whose paper is it anyway?

  {"id":"Umetani1998","abstract":"Objectives. This study sought to define the effects of age and gender effects on the normal range of time domain heart rate variability (HRV) over nine decades in healthy subjects. Background. Low HRV is considered an independent marker of mortality risk. However, the age-related decline in HRV may limit its predictive value, particularly in the elderly. Delineation of the range of HRV in healthy subjects over the life span is needed. Gender- related differences in HRV also need clarification. Methods. We determined, according to decade, 24-h heart rate (HR) and HRV of 260 healthy subjects (10 to 99 years old; 112 male, 148 female) by means of five standard time domain measures: standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals over 24 h (SDNN), standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-mm segments (SDANN), mean of the standard deviations of all normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments (SDNN index), root-mean-square of successive normal sinus RR interval difference (rMSSD) and the percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms (pNN50). Results. 1) HRV decreased with aging, the pattern of change being measure dependent. HRV (SDNN and SDANN) decreased only very gradually, reaching 60% of baseline (second-decade values) by the tenth decade. With the SDNN index, HRV decreased linearly with aging, reaching 46% of baseline by the tenth decade. Using pNN50 and rMSSD, HRV decreased most rapidly, reaching 24% and 47% of baseline, respectively, by the sixth decade and then stabilized. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of subjects >65 years old fell below published cutpoints for increased risk of mortality in 25%, 12% and 4%, respectively. 3) At age <30 years, HRV for all measures was lower in female than male subjects. Gender differences decreased at age >30 years and disappeared at age >50 years. 4) HR also declined with aging but much more slowly. HR at age <50 years was faster in female than in male subjects. Gender differences disappeared thereafter. Conclusions. 1) Using all measures, HRV of healthy subjects declines with aging, with measure-dependent patterns. 2) Using the SDNN index, rMSSD and pNN50, HRV of healthy subjects, particularly those >65 years old, may decrease to below levels associated with increased risk of mortality. 3)Gender influences HRV. Gender differences in HRV are age and measure dependent. 4) Age and gender also affect heart rate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Umetani","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Singer","given":"Donald H"},{"family":"McCraty","given":"Rollin"},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"Umetani1998","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/S0735-1097(97)00554-8","ISBN":"0735-1097","ISSN":"07351097","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3,1]]},"page":"593-601","PMID":"9502641","title":"Twenty-four hour time domain heart rate variability and heart rate: Relations to age and gender over nine decades","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9502641","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"Uno2013","abstract":"Risk prediction procedures can be quite useful for the patient's treatment selection, prevention strategy, or disease management in evidence-based medicine. Often, potentially important new predictors are available in addition to the conventional markers. The question is how to quantify the improvement from the new markers for prediction of the patient's risk in order to aid cost-benefit decisions. The standard method, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, to measure the added value may not be sensitive enough to capture incremental improvements from the new markers. Recently, some novel alternatives to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, such as integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement, were proposed. In this paper, we consider a class of measures for evaluating the incremental values of new markers, which includes the preceding two as special cases. We present a unified procedure for making inferences about measures in the class with censored event time data. The large sample properties of our procedures are theoretically justified.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2008","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between depression and heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of twins. Reduced HRV, a measure of autonomic dysfunction, has been linked to depression but many studies have inadequately controlled for familial and environmental factors. Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.\\n\\nMETHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\\n\\nRESULTS: Both current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: A shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV. These two phenotypes may be the expression of a generalized neurobiological perturbation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Lampert","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2009a","abstract":"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms are unclear. The presence of MDD may increase CHD risk by affecting microvascular circulation. It is also plausible that genetic factors influencing MDD may overlap with those for CHD. We sought to examine the relationship between MDD and coronary flow reserve (CFR), the ratio of maximum flow during stress to flow at rest measured in milliliters per minute per gram of tissue. Methods We examined 289 male middle-aged twins, including 106 twins (53 twin pairs) discordant for a lifetime history of MDD and 183 control twins (unrelated to any twins in the experimental group) without MDD. To calculate CFR, we used positron emission tomography with nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia to evaluate myocardial blood flow at rest and after adenosine stress. A standard perfusion defect score was also used to assess myocardial ischemia. Results There was no difference in myocardial ischemia between twins with and without MDD. Among the dizygotic twin pairs discordant for MDD, the CFR was 14% lower in the twins with MDD than in their brothers without MDD (2.36 vs 2.74) (P = .03). This association was not present in the monozygotic discordant pairs who were genetically matched (2.86 vs 2.64) (P = .19). The zygosity-MDD interaction after adjustment was significant (P = .006). The CFR in the dizygotic twins with MDD was also lower than in the control twins. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for a shared genetic pathway between MDD and microvascular dysfunction.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2011","abstract":"Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between inflammation and coronary microvascular function in asymptomatic individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Background: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early precursor of coronary artery disease (CAD) thought to result from endothelial cell activation and inflammation, but data are limited. Methods: We examined 268 asymptomatic male monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell activation included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell count (WBC), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Blood flow quantitation was obtained with [13N] ammonia PET at rest and after adenosine stress. CFR was measured as the ratio of maximum flow to baseline flow at rest; abnormal CFR was defined as a ratio <2.5. A summed stress score for visible perfusion defects was calculated. Results: In within-pair analyses, all biomarkers, except VCAM-1, were higher in twins with lower CFR than their brothers with higher CFR (p < 0.05). This was observed in the entire sample, as well as within pairs discordant for a CFR of <2.5. Associations persisted after adjusting for summed stress score and CAD risk factors. In contrast no biomarker, except IL-6, was related to the summed stress score of visible defects. Conclusions: Even in asymptomatic subjects, a decrease in coronary microvascular function is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response, independent of CAD risk factors.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2014","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Emotional stress may disproportionally affect young women with ischemic heart disease. We sought to examine whether mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI), but not exercise-induced ischemia, is more common in young women with previous myocardial infarction (MI) than in men.\\n\\nMETHODS: We studied 98 post-MI patients (49 women and 49 men) aged 38 to 60 years. Women and men were matched for age, MI type, and months since MI. Patients underwent technetium-99m sestamibi perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress, and after exercise/pharmacological stress. Perfusion defect scores were obtained with observer-independent software. A summed difference score (SDS), the difference between stress and rest scores, was used to quantify ischemia under both stress conditions.\\n\\nRESULTS: Women 50 years or younger, but not older women, showed a more adverse psychosocial profile than did age-matched men but did not differ for conventional risk factors and tended to have less angiographic coronary artery disease. Compared with age-matched men, women 50 years or younger exhibited a higher SDS with mental stress (3.1 versus 1.5, p = .029) and had twice the rate of MSIMI (SDS ≥ 3; 52% versus 25%), whereas ischemia with physical stress did not differ (36% versus 25%).

  {"id":"Vaccarino2016a","abstract":"BACKGROUND Emerging data suggest that young women with coronary heart disease (CHD) are disproportionally vulnerable to the adverse cardiovascular effects of psychological stress. We hypothesized that younger, but not older, women with stable CHD are more likely than their male peers to develop mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI). METHODS AND RESULTS We studied 686 patients (191 women) with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). Patients underwent (99m)Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and with both mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress testing. We compared quantitative (by automated software) and visual parameters of inducible ischemia between women and men and assessed age as an effect modifier. Women had a more-adverse psychosocial profile than men whereas there were few differences in medical history and CHD risk factors. Both quantitative and visual indicators of ischemia with mental stress were disproportionally larger in younger women. For each 10 years of decreasing age, the total reversibility severity score with mental stress was 9.6 incremental points higher (interaction, P<0.001) and the incidence of MSIMI was 82.6% higher (interaction, P=0.004) in women than in men. Incidence of MSIMI in women ≤50 years was almost 4-fold higher than in men of similar age and older patients. These results persisted when adjusting for sociodemographic and medical risk factors, psychosocial factors, and medications.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown. METHODS We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental stress. The digital vasomotor response to mental stress was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) stress. RESULTS The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22-61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental stress but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental stress, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after stress. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental stress. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, P=0.009), and ischemia with conventional stress was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, P=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental stress (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only. CONCLUSIONS Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional stress ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental stress are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women's proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Samaah"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Wilmot","given":"Kobina"},{"family":"Al Mheid","given":"Ibhar"},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Elon","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik M."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Ernest V."},{"family":"Nye","given":"Jonathon"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Alkhoder","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Levantsevych","given":"Oleksiy"},{"family":"Gay","given":"Hawkins"},{"family":"Obideen","given":"Malik"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Minxuan"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Tené T."},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Vaccarino2021a","abstract":"Importance: Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a recognized phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its clinical significance in the contemporary clinical era has not been investigated. Objective: To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020). Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure. Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical value..","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaccarino","given":"Viola"},{"family":"Almuwaqqat","given":"Zakaria"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jeong Hwan"},{"family":"Hammadah","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J.

  {"id":"Vadmann2017","abstract":"Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a similar mortality and thrombo-embolic risk, after an atrial ablation procedure, compared with an atrial fibrillation (AF) procedure. Methods and results: Using data from nationwide Danish health registries, we identified patients aged 18–75 years undergoing a first- time atrial flutter or an AF ablation procedure in the period 2000–13. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) after 5 years of follow-up, adjusting for concomitant risk factors. A total of 1096 and 2266 patients underwent an ablation for atrial flutter or AF, respectively. Age distribution was similar in the two, but atrial flutter patients had more co-morbidities. During 5 years of follow-up, we observed 38 and 36 deaths in the atrial flutter and AF groups, corresponding to an almost two-fold higher mortality rate among atrial flutter patients [crude HR 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–3.03]. The higher mortality rate persisted after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.05–2.69). The rate of thrombo-embolic events was similar in the two groups (crude HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.71–2.56; adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.41). Conclusion: In this observational study, patients with atrial flutter had a significantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared with those with AF after an ablation procedure, but similar thrombo-embolic event rates.

  {"id":"Vaitkevicius2009","abstract":"Background: Atrial ectopic discharges originating in the pulmonary veins (PVs) are known to initiate atrial fibrillation (AF), which may be terminated by catheter-based PV isolation. Because a functional relationship exists between cardiac autonomic effects and PVs in arrhythmogenesis, it has been suggested that discharges of the nerves that proceed to the PVs and interconnect with intrinsic ganglionated nerve plexuses are potential triggers of AF in man. Objective: This study sought to determine the characteristics and distribution of neural routes by which autonomic nerves supply the human PVs. Methods: We examined the intrinsic neural structures of 35 intact (nonsectioned) left atrial (LA)-PV complexes stained transmurally for acetylcholinesterase using a stereomicroscope. Results: The epicardial ganglionated nerves pass onto the extrapulmonary segments of the human PVs from the middle, left dorsal, and dorsal right atrial subplexuses. The left and right inferior PVs involved a lesser number of ganglia than the left and right superior PVs. Abundant extensions of epicardial nerves penetrate transmurally the PV walls and form a patchy neural network beneath the endothelium of PVs. The subendothelial neural meshwork with numerous free nerve endings, which appeared to be typical sensory compact nerve endings, was mostly situated at the roots of the 4 PVs. No ganglia were identified beneath the endothelium of the human PVs. Conclusion: The richest areas containing epicardial ganglia, from which intrinsic nerves extend to the human PVs, are concentrated at the inferior surface of both the inferior and left superior PVs. Therefore, these locations might be considered as potential targets for focal pulmonary vein ablation in catheter-based therapy of AF. © 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaitkevicius","given":"Raimundas"},{"family":"Saburkina","given":"Inga"},{"family":"Rysevaite","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Vaitkeviciene","given":"Inga"},{"family":"Pauziene","given":"Neringa"},{"family":"Zaliunas","given":"Remigijus"},{"family":"Schauerte","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Jalife","given":"José"},{"family":"Pauza","given":"Dainius H"}],"citation-key":"Vaitkevicius2009","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2008.10.027","ISSN":"15475271","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"221-228","title":"Nerve Supply of the Human Pulmonary Veins: An Anatomical Study","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Valderrabano2020","abstract":"Importance: Catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) has limited success. Procedural strategies beyond pulmonary vein isolation have failed to consistently improve results. The vein of Marshall contains innervation and AF triggers that can be ablated by retrograde ethanol infusion. Objective: To determine whether vein of Marshall ethanol infusion could improve ablation results in persistent AF when added to catheter ablation. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Vein of Marshall Ethanol for Untreated Persistent AF (VENUS) trial was an investigator-initiated, National Institutes of Health-funded, randomized, single-blinded trial conducted in 12 centers in the United States. Patients (N = 350) with persistent AF referred for first ablation were enrolled from October 2013 through June 2018. Follow-up concluded in June 2019. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to catheter ablation alone (n = 158) or catheter ablation combined with vein of Marshall ethanol infusion (n = 185) in a 1:1.15 ratio to accommodate for 15% technical vein of Marshall ethanol infusion failures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was freedom from AF or atrial tachycardia for longer than 30 seconds after a single procedure, without antiarrhythmic drugs, at both 6 and 12 months. Outcome assessment was blinded to randomization treatment. There were 12 secondary outcomes, including AF burden, freedom from AF after multiple procedures, perimitral block, and others. Results: Of the 343 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 66.5 [9.7] years; 261 men), 316 (92.1%) completed the trial. Vein of Marshall ethanol was successfully delivered in 155 of 185 patients. At 6 and 12 months, the proportion of patients with freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia after a single procedure was 49.2% (91/185) in the catheter ablation combined with vein of Marshall ethanol infusion group compared with 38% (60/158) in the catheter ablation alone group (difference, 11.2% [95% CI, 0.8%-21.7%]; P =.04). Of the 12 secondary outcomes, 9 were not significantly different, but AF burden (zero burden in 78.3% vs 67.9%; difference, 10.4% [95% CI, 2.9%-17.9%]; P =.01), freedom from AF after multiple procedures (65.2% vs 53.8%; difference, 11.4% [95% CI, 0.6%-22.2%]; P =.04), and success achieving perimitral block (80.6% vs 51.3%; difference, 29.3% [95% CI, 19.3%-39.3%]; P <.001) were significantly improved in vein of Marshall-treated patients. Adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with persistent AF, addition of vein of Marshall ethanol infusion to catheter ablation, compared with catheter ablation alone, increased the likelihood of remaining free of AF or atrial tachycardia at 6 and 12 months.

  {"id":"Vandenberk2016","abstract":"BACKGROUND Drug safety precautions recommend monitoring of the corrected QT interval. To determine which QT correction formula to use in an automated QT-monitoring algorithm in our electronic medical record, we studied rate correction performance of different QT correction formulae and their impact on risk assessment for mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS All electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients >18 years with sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration and rate <90 beats per minute (bpm) in the University Hospitals of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) during a 2-month period were included. QT correction was performed with Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, Hodges, and Rautaharju formulae. In total, 6609 patients were included (age, 59.8±16.2 years; 53.6% male and heart rate 68.8±10.6 bpm). Optimal rate correction was observed using Fridericia and Framingham; Bazett performed worst. A healthy subset showed 99% upper limits of normal for Bazett above current clinical standards: men 472 ms (95% CI, 464-478 ms) and women 482 ms (95% CI 474-490 ms). Multivariate Cox regression, including age, heart rate, and prolonged QTc, identified Framingham (hazard ratio [HR], 7.31; 95% CI, 4.10-13.05) and Fridericia (HR, 5.95; 95% CI, 3.34-10.60) as significantly better predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality than Bazett (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.31-8.74). In a point-prevalence study with haloperidol, the number of patients classified to be at risk for possibly harmful QT prolongation could be reduced by 50% using optimal QT rate correction. CONCLUSIONS Fridericia and Framingham correction formulae showed the best rate correction and significantly improved prediction of 30-day and 1-year mortality. With current clinical standards, Bazett overestimated the number of patients with potential dangerous QTc prolongation, which could lead to unnecessary safety measurements as withholding the patient of first-choice medication.","author":[{"family":"Vandenberk","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Vandael","given":"Eline"},{"family":"Robyns","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Vandenberghe","given":"Joris"},{"family":"Garweg","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Foulon","given":"Veerle"},{"family":"Ector","given":"Joris"},{"family":"Willems","given":"Rik"}],"citation-key":"Vandenberk2016","container-title":"Journal of the American Heart Association","DOI":"10.1161/JAHA.116.003264","ISBN":"2047-9980","ISSN":"20479980","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"PMID":"27317349","title":"Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring?","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"VanderLingen2021","abstract":"Background In survivors of sudden cardiac arrest with obstructive coronary artery disease, it remains challenging to distinguish ischemia as a reversible cause from irreversible scar-related ventricular arrhythmias. We aimed to evaluate the value of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in sudden cardiac arrest survivors with presumably reversible ischemia and complete revascularization. Methods and Results This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 276 patients (80% men, age 67±10 years) receiving ICD implantation for secondary prevention. Angiography was performed before ICD implantation. A subgroup of 166 (60%) patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement before implantation. Patients were divided in 2 groups, (1) ICD-per-guideline, including 228 patients with incomplete revascularization or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, and (2) ICD-off-label, including 48 patients with complete revascularization and left ventricular ejection fraction >35%. The primary outcome was time to appropriate device therapy (ADT). During 4.0 years (interquartile range, 3.5-4.6) of follow-up, ADT developed in 15% of the ICD-off-label group versus 43% of the ICD-per-guideline group. Time to ADT was comparable in the ICD-off-label and ICD-per-guideline groups (hazard ratio (HR), 0.46; P=0.08). No difference in mortality was observed (HR, 0.95; P=0.93). Independent predictors of ADT included age (HR, 1.03; P=0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume HR, (1.05 per 10 mL increase; P<0.01) and extent of transmural late gadolinium enhancement (HR, 1.12; P=0.04). Conclusions This study demonstrates that sudden cardiac arrest survivors with coronary artery disease remain at high risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, even after complete revascularization and with preserved left ventricular function.

The causal inference literature has not, however, produced a clear formal definition of a confounder, as it has given priority to the concept of confounding over that of a confounder. We consider a number of candidate definitions arising from various more informal statements made in the literature. We consider the properties satisfied by each candidate definition, principally focusing on (i) whether under the candidate definition control for all “confounders” suffices to control for “confounding” and (ii) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias. Several of the candidate definitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a “confounder” be defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on (X, C) but such that for no proper subset of (X, C) is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset.

  {"id":"VanDijk2020","abstract":"Introduction: In patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) but preserved left ventricular (LV) function, sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) may arise in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is unknown whether an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is mandatory in these patients as VA might be triggered by a reversible cause. The purpose of this study is to analyze the benefit of ICD therapy in this patient population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in ICD recipients implanted from 2008 to 2011. The study group consisted of patients with sustained VA in the setting of an ACS, with a history of MI, but with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35 (group A). The two control groups consisted of patients admitted with VA with a history of MI, but without ACS at presentation, either with LVEF greater than 35% (group B) or ≤35% (group C). The primary endpoint was the number of patients with appropriate ICD therapy (antitachycardia pacing or shock). Results: A total of 291 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 5.3 years. Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 45.6% of the patients in group A vs 51.6% and 60.4% in groups B and C (P =.11). In group A, 31.1% received an appropriate ICD shock vs 34.7% and 44.3% in control groups B and C (P =.12). Conclusion: On the basis of these data, ICD implantation seems warranted in patients with history of MI presenting with VA in the setting of an ACS, despite preserved LV function and adequate revascularization. Further trials, preferably randomizes, should be performed to address these findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dijk","given":"Vincent F.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Quast","given":"Anne‐Floor Floor B.E."},{"family":"Schaap","given":"Jeroen"},{"family":"Balt","given":"Jippe C."},{"family":"Kelder","given":"J.

  {"id":"VanHouwelingen2001","abstract":"Background: Annual patterns in suicide rates, peaking near the summer solstice, are well documented. It has been suggested that day length or total hours of sunshine has an impact on suicide rates. If these environmental factors are involved, we would expect changes in the daily pattern of suicide rates to occur over the year. To test this hypothesis, the 24-h patterns of suicide rate were investigated as a function of time of year. Method: Detailed information about the exact time of suicides in The Netherlands is only available for train suicides. Therefore, information concerning age, sex, time and place of occurrence of all verified train suicides over 15 years in The Netherlands (n = 2830) was obtained from The Netherlands Railways archives. Results: Daily patterns in train suicides show systematic variations of two kinds. First, independently of time of year, suicide rates at night drop to about 10% of their daytime values. Second, there are two daily peaks in the patterns which shift their timing over the year, with one peak occurring shortly after sunset, and the other one consistently occurring 9-10 h earlier. Both peaks shift with the 5.5-h shift in sunset time. Limitations: Train suicidal behaviour may not represent fatal suicidal behaviour in general. Conclusions: There are pronounced and systematic daily variations in train suicide rates in The Netherlands. One of these is related to clock time, the others are related to the light-dark cycle. The consistency of the patterns suggests a strong environmental influence on train suicidal behaviour.

  {"id":"VanNieuwenhuyse2017","abstract":"Early Afterdepolarizations, EADs, are defined as the reversal of the action potential before completion of the repolarization phase, which can result in ectopic beats. However, the series of mechanisms of EADs leading to these ectopic beats and related cardiac arrhythmias are not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of this single cell behavior on the whole heart level. For this study we used a modified version of the Ten Tusscher-Panfilov model of human ventricular cells (TP06) which we implemented in a 3D ventricle model including realistic fiber orientations. To increase the likelihood of EAD formation at the single cell level, we reduced the repolarization reserve (RR) by reducing the rapid delayed rectifier Potassium current and raising the L-type Calcium current. Varying these parameters defined a 2D parametric space where different excitation patterns could be classified. Depending on the initial conditions, by either exciting the ventricles with a spiral formation or burst pacing protocol, we found multiple different spatio-temporal excitation patterns. The spiral formation protocol resulted in the categorization of a stable spiral (S), a meandering spiral (MS), a spiral break-up regime (SB), spiral fibrillation type B (B), spiral fibrillation type A (A) and an oscillatory excitation type (O). The last three patterns are a 3D generalization of previously found patterns in 2D. First, the spiral fibrillation type B showed waves determined by a chaotic bi-excitable regime, i.e. mediated by both Sodium and Calcium waves at the same time and in same tissue settings. In the parameter region governed by the B pattern, single cells were able to repolarize completely and different (spiral) waves chaotically burst into each other without finishing a 360 degree rotation. Second, spiral fibrillation type A patterns consisted of multiple small rotating spirals. Single cells failed to repolarize to the resting membrane potential hence prohibiting the Sodium channel gates to recover. Accordingly, we found that Calcium waves mediated these patterns. Third, a further reduction of the RR resulted in a more exotic parameter regime whereby the individual cells behaved independently as oscillators. The patterns arose due to a phase-shift of different oscillators as disconnection of the cells resulted in continuation of the patterns. For all patterns, we computed realistic 9 lead ECGs by including a torso model. The B and A type pattern exposed the behavior of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). We conclude that EADs at the single cell level can result in different types of cardiac fibrillation at the tissue and 3D ventricle level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Nieuwenhuyse","given":"Enid"},{"family":"Seemann","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Panfilov","given":"Alexander V."},{"family":"Vandersickel","given":"Nele"}],"citation-key":"VanNieuwenhuyse2017","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0188867","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"page":"e0188867","PMID":"29216239","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Effects of early afterdepolarizations on excitation patterns in an accurate model of the human ventricles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188867","volume":"12"},

Although various terms have been applied to severe hypertension, such as hypertensive crises, emergencies, or urgencies, they are all characterized by acute elevations in BP that may be associated with end-organ damage (hypertensive crisis). The immediate reduction of BP is only required in patients with acute end-organ damage. Hypertension associated with cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage only rarely requires treatment. While nitroprus-side is commonly used to treat severe hypertension, it is an extremely toxic drug that should only be used in rare circumstances.

  {"id":"Vaseghi2012","abstract":"Background: The sympathetic nervous system is thought to play a role in the genesis of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). Left and added right cardiac sympathectomy have been shown to reduce the burden of arrhythmias in the setting of a VT storm. However, the contribution of the right stellate ganglion (RSG) and the left stellate ganglion (LSG) to the innervation of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall is not well understood. Objective: To evaluate the innervation of the anterior LV wall by the LSG and the RSG. Methods: The heart and stellate ganglia were exposed via sternotomy in pigs with normal hearts (n = 8). A 20-electrode catheter was placed on the anterior LV wall to record activation recovery interval (ARI), a surrogate measure of action potential duration. A microdialysis catheter was inserted in a similar location to sample interstitial norepinephrine (NE) content. ARI and NE measurements were recorded at baseline and during LSG and RSG stimulation. Results: LSG stimulation shortened ARI by 17.1% ± 10.5% (mean ± standard error), while RSG stimulation shortened ARI by 42.1% ± 15.7%, P =.04 (LSG vs RSG). LSG stimulation increased interstitial NE levels by 200% ± 65%, while RSG stimulation increased the NE content by 260% ± 40% (P =.012). LSG stimulation increased dispersion in ARI from 376.0 ± 83.7 ms2 to 1242.5 ± 566 ms2 (P =.03) and caused ventricular fibrillation in 2 pigs. During RSG stimulation, dispersion increased from 419 ± 65.8 to 474.8 ± 81 ms2 (P =.4). Conclusions: Both the LSG and the RSG provide significant innervation to the anterior LV wall as demonstrated by both ARI shortening and NE concentrations. LSG stimulation significantly increases ARI dispersion.

  {"id":"Veenhuyzen2012a","abstract":"The approach to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) diagnosis can be complex because it involves synthesizing baseline electrophysiologic features, features of the SVT, and the response(s) to pacing maneuvers. In this two-part review, we will mainly explore the latter while recognizing that neither of the former can be ignored, for they provide the context in which diagnostic pacing maneuvers must be correctly chosen and interpreted. Part 1 involved a detailed consideration of ventricular overdrive pacing, since this pacing maneuver provides the diagnosis in the majority of cases. In Part 2, other diagnostic pacing maneuvers that might be helpful when ventricular overdrive pacing is not diagnostic or appropriate, including attempts to reset SVT with single atrial or ventricular beats, para-Hisian pacing, apex versus base pacing, and atrial overdrive pacing, are discussed, as are some specific diagnostic SVT challenges encountered in the electrophysiology lab. There is considerable literature on this topic, and this review is by no means meant to be all-encompassing.

  {"id":"Velazquez2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute decompensated heart failure accounts for more than 1 million hospitalizations in the United States annually. Whether the initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy is safe and effective among patients who are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure at 129 sites in the United States. After hemodynamic stabilization, patients were randomly assigned to receive sacubitril-valsartan (target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or enalapril (target dose, 10 mg twice daily). The primary efficacy outcome was the time-averaged proportional change in the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration from baseline through weeks 4 and 8. Key safety outcomes were the rates of worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema. RESULTS: Of the 881 patients who underwent randomization, 440 were assigned to receive sacubitril-valsartan and 441 to receive enalapril. The time-averaged reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration was significantly greater in the sacubitril-valsartan group than in the enalapril group; the ratio of the geometric mean of values obtained at weeks 4 and 8 to the baseline value was 0.53 in the sacubitril-valsartan group as compared with 0.75 in the enalapril group (percent change, −46.7% vs. −25.3%; ratio of change with sacubitril-valsartan vs. enalapril, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.81; P<0.001). The greater reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration with sacubitril-valsartan than with enalapril was evident as early as week 1 (ratio of change, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.85). The rates of worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure, the initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy led to a greater reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration than enalapril therapy. Rates of worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema did not differ significantly between the two groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Velazquez","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Morrow","given":"David A."},{"family":"DeVore","given":"Adam D."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Carol I."},{"family":"Ambrosy","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"McCague","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Braunwald","given":"Eugene"}],"citation-key":"Velazquez2019","container-title":"New England Journal of Medicine","DOI":"10.1056/nejmoa1812851","ISSN":"0028-4793","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"539-548","PMID":"30415601","title":"Angiotensin–Neprilysin Inhibition in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure","type":"article-journal","volume":"380"},
  {"id":"Ventetuolo2014","abstract":"Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs when the RV fails to maintain enough blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to achieve adequate left ventricular filling. This can occur suddenly in a previously healthy heart due to massive pulmonary embolism or right-sided myocardial infarction, but many cases encountered in the intensive care unit involve worsening of compensated RV failure in the setting of chronic heart and lung disease. Management of RV failure is directed at optimizing right-sided filling pressures and reducing afterload. Due to a lower level of vascular tone, vasoactive medications have less salient effects on reducing vascular resistance in the pulmonary than in the systemic circulation. Successful management requires reversal of any conditions that heighten pulmonary vascular tone and the use of selective pulmonary vasodilators at doses that do not induce systemic hypotension or worsening of oxygenation. Systemic systolic arterial pressure should be kept close to RV systolic pressure to maintain RV perfusion. When these efforts fail, the judicious use of inotropic agents may help improve RV contractility enough to maintain cardiac output. Extracorporeal life support is increasingly being used to support patients with acute RV failure who fail to respond to medical management while the underlying cause of their RV failure is addressed.

  {"id":"Vest2018","abstract":"Abstract Variability metrics hold promise as potential indicators for autonomic function, prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, psychophysiological status, and general wellness. Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series, and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Vest","given":"Adriana N."},{"family":"Da Poian","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Li","given":"Qiao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengyu"},{"family":"Nemati","given":"Shamim"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Clifford","given":"Gari D."}],"citation-key":"Vest2018","container-title":"Physiological Measurement","DOI":"10.1088/1361-6579/aae021","ISBN":"2514599342","ISSN":"1361-6579","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,11]]},"page":"105004","PMID":"30199376","title":"An open source benchmarked toolbox for cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30199376","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"Vetter2020","abstract":"The circadian system regulates physiology and behavior. Acute challenges to the system, such as those experienced when traveling across time zones, will eventually result in re-synchronization to local environmental time cues, but this re-synchronization is oftentimes accompanied by adverse short-term consequences. When such challenges are experienced chronically, adaptation may not be achieved, as for example in the case of rotating night shift workers. The transient and chronic disturbance of the circadian system is most frequently referred to as “circadian disruption”, but many other terms have been proposed and used to refer to similar situations. It is now beyond doubt that the circadian system contributes to health and disease, emphasizing the need for clear terminology when describing challenges to the circadian system and their consequences. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the terms used to describe disruption of the circadian system, discuss proposed quantifications of disruption in experimental and observational settings with a focus on human research, and highlight limitations and challenges of currently available tools. For circadian research to advance as a translational science, clear, operationalizable, and scalable quantifications of circadian disruption are key, as they will enable improved assessment and reproducibility of results, ideally ranging from mechanistic settings, including animal research, to large-scale randomized clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Vetter","given":"Céline"}],"citation-key":"Vetter2020","container-title":"European Journal of Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1111/ejn.14255","ISSN":"14609568","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"page":"531-550","PMID":"30402904","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","title":"Circadian disruption: What do we actually mean?","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"Vichinsky1995","abstract":"Background. Preoperative transfusions are frequently given to prevent perioperative morbidity in pa- tients with sickle cell anemia. There is no consensus, how- ever, on the best regimen of transfusions for this purpose. Methods. We conducted a multicenter study to com- pare the rates of perioperative complications among pa- tients randomly assigned to receive either an aggressive transfusion regimen designed to decrease the hemoglo- bin S level to less than 30 percent (group 1) or a conser- vative regimen designed to increase the hemoglobin level to 10 g per deciliter (group 2). Results. Patients undergoing a total of 604 operations were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. The se- verity of the disease, compliance with the protocol, and the types of operations were similar in the two groups. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 11 g per deciliter in group 1 and 10.6 g per deciliter in group 2. The preop- erative value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group 1 and 59 percent in group 2. The most frequent opera- tions were cholecystectomies (232), head and neck sur- gery (156), and orthopedic surgery (72). With the excep- tion of transfusion-related complications, which occurred in 14 percent of the operations in group 1 and in 7 percent of those in group 2, the frequency of serious complica- tions was similar in the two groups (31 percent in group 1 and 35 percent in group 2). The acute chest syndrome developed in 10 percent of both groups and resulted in two deaths in group 1. A history of pulmonary disease and a higher risk associated with surgery were significant pre- dictors of the acute chest syndrome. Conclusions.

Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14%), did not receive transfusions (P<0.001) [corrected].The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% vs. 91%; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.92; P=0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% as compared with 48% (P=0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37).

  {"id":"Vincenzi2019","abstract":"In tightly coupled complex systems, when two or more factors or events interact in unanticipated ways, catastrophic failures of high-risk technical systems happen rarely, but quickly. Safety features are commonly built into complex systems to avoid disasters but are often part of the problem. The human body may be considered as a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure (sudden unexpected death, SUD) when certain factors or events interact. The mammalian dive response (MDR) is a built-in safety feature of the body that normally conserves oxygen during acute hypoxia. Activation of the MDR is the final pathway to sudden cardiac (SCD) in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and sudden cardiac death in water (SCDIW, fatal drowning). There is no single cause in any of these death scenarios, but an array of, unanticipated, often unknown, factors or events that activate or interact with the mammalian dive reflex. In any particular case, the relevant risk factors or events might include a combination of genetic, developmental, metabolic, disease, environmental, or operational influences. Determination of a single cause in any of these death scenarios is unlikely. The common thread among these seemingly different death scenarios is activation of the mammalian dive response. The human body is a complex tightly coupled system at risk of rare catastrophic failure when that “safety feature” is activated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Vincenzi","given":"Frank F."}],"citation-key":"Vincenzi2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","ISSN":"1664-042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Sudden Unexpected Death and the Mammalian Dive Response: Catastrophic Failure of a Complex Tightly Coupled System","title-short":"Sudden Unexpected Death and the Mammalian Dive Response","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00097","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"Virtanen2003a","abstract":"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether psychological factors are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) among healthy middle-aged men and women. Methods: A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35-64 years of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger systolic arterial pressure and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure variabilities. Psychological factors were evaluated by three self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Psychological factors were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS (p = 0.001) and higher low-frequency (p = 0.002) power of systolic arterial pressure variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased low-frequency power of diastolic arterial pressure (p = 0.001) and increased high-frequency power of systolic arterial pressure (p = 0.033) variability. Conclusions: Anxiety and hostility are related to reduced BRS and increased low-frequency power of BPV. Reduced BRS reflects decreased parasympathetic outflow to the heart and may increase BPV through an increased sympathetic predominance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Virtanen","given":"Raine"},{"family":"Jula","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Salminen","given":"Jouko K."},{"family":"Voipio-Pulkki","given":"Liisa Maria"},{"family":"Helenius","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Kuusela","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Airaksinen","given":"Juhani"}],"citation-key":"Virtanen2003a","container-title":"Psychosomatic Medicine","DOI":"10.1097/01.PSY.0000088760.65046.CF","ISSN":"00333174","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",9]]},"page":"751-756","title":"Anxiety and hostility are associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity and increased beat-to-beat blood pressure variability","type":"article-journal","volume":"65"},
  {"id":"Vitolo2021","abstract":"<p>Background and purpose: Given the great clinical heterogeneity of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, conventional classification only based on disease subtype or arrhythmia patterns may not adequately characterize this population. We aimed to identify different groups of AF patients who shared common clinical phenotypes using cluster analysis and evaluate the association between identified clusters and clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis in AF patients from AMADEUS and BOREALIS trials. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke/thromboembolism (TE), cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction, and/or all-cause death. Individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding were also assessed. Results: We included 3980 AF patients treated with the Vitamin-K Antagonist from the AMADEUS and BOREALIS studies. The analysis identified four clusters in which patients varied significantly among clinical characteristics. Cluster 1 was characterized by patients with low rates of CV risk factors and comorbidities; Cluster 2 was characterized by patients with a high burden of CV risk factors; Cluster 3 consisted of patients with a high burden of CV comorbidities; Cluster 4 was characterized by the highest rates of non-CV comorbidities. After a mean follow-up of 365 (standard deviation 187) days, Cluster 4 had the highest cumulative risk of outcomes. Compared with Cluster 1, Cluster 4 was independently associated with an increased risk for the composite outcome (hazard ratio (HR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70–3.46), all-cause death (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.58–3.49) and major bleeding (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.19–3.96). Conclusions: Cluster analysis identified four different clinically relevant phenotypes of AF patients that had unique clinical characteristics and different outcomes. Cluster analysis highlights the high degree of heterogeneity in patients with AF, suggesting the need for a phenotype-driven approach to comorbidities, which could provide a more holistic approach to management aimed to improve patients’ outcomes.</p>","author":[{"family":"Vitolo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Proietti","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Shantsila","given":"Alena"},{"family":"Boriani","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Lip","given":"Gregory Y.

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology.

Disturbed Na and Ca handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. In cardiomyocytes, many ion channels and transporters, including voltage-gated Na and Ca channels, cardiac ryanodine receptors, Na/Ca-exchanger, and SR Ca-ATPase are involved in this regulation. We have learned a lot about the pathophysiological relevance of disturbed ion channel function from monogenetic disorders. Changes in the gating of a single ion channel and the activity of an ion pump suffice to dramatically increase the propensity for arrhythmias even in structurally normal hearts. Nevertheless, patients with heart failure with acquired dysfunction in many ion channels and transporters exhibit profound dysregulation of Na and Ca handling and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and are especially prone to arrhythmias. A deeper understanding of the underlying arrhythmic principles is mandatory if we are to improve their outcome.

Development of effective, low-cost, and noninvasive SCD risk stratification tools is necessary. Methods and Results - Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and Cardiovascular Health Study (n=20 177; age, 59.3±10.1 years; age range, 44-100 years; 56% female; 77% white) were followed up for 14.0 years (median). Five ECG markers of global electric heterogeneity (GEH; sum absolute QRST integral, spatial QRST angle, spatial ventricular gradient [SVG] magnitude, SVG elevation, and SVG azimuth) were measured on standard 12-lead ECGs. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks models evaluated associations between GEH electrocardiographic parameters and SCD. An SCD competing risks score was derived from demographics, comorbidities, and GEH parameters. SCD incidence was 1.86 per 1000 person-years. After multivariable adjustment, baseline GEH parameters and large increases in GEH parameters over time were independently associated with SCD. Final SCD risk scores included age, sex, race, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, and GEH parameters as continuous variables. When GEH parameters were added to clinical/demographic factors, the C statistic increased from 0.777 to 0.790 (P=0.008), the risk score classified 10-year SCD risk as high (>5%) in 7.2% of participants, 10% of SCD victims were appropriately reclassified into a high-risk category, and only 1.4% of SCD victims were inappropriately reclassified from high to intermediate risk.

  {"id":"Waldo2000","abstract":"After atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is the most important and most common atrial tachyarrhythmia. Although it was first described 80 years ago, techniques for its diagnosis and management have changed little for decades. The diagnosis rested almost entirely with the 12 lead ECG, and treatment options included only the use of a digitalis compound to slow and control the ventricular response rate, and/or the use of either quinidine or procainamide in an attempt to convert the rhythm to sinus rhythm or to prevent recurrence of atrial flutter once sinus rhythm was established.\n\nThe past 25 years have produced major changes. A series of studies has advanced our understanding of the mechanism(s) of atrial flutter. Old techniques to diagnose atrial flutter have been significantly refined, and new diagnostic techniques have been developed. Beginning with the advent of DC cardioversion in the 1960s, major advances in the treatment of atrial flutter have occurred. β Blockers and calcium channel blockers are now available for use as an adjunct to or in lieu of digitalis treatment to control the ventricular response rate. New antiarrhythmic agents are available for use to suppress atrial flutter or convert it to sinus rhythm. Atrial pacing techniques to interrupt or suppress atrial flutter have evolved. Catheter ablation techniques either to cure atrial flutter or to control the ventricular response rate have been developed, and related surgical treatments are available. Even automatic low energy cardioversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm has been developed.\n\nMost of the advances in our understanding of atrial flutter have come from our understanding its mechanism.

Injection of nicotine or veratridine into the Cx consistently resulted in larger decreases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and in gracilis perfusion pressure than were observed following injection of the same dose into the LAD. Vagotomy abolished the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses to intracoronary nicotine or veratridine. The weight of left ventricle perfused by LAD or Cx was not different (43.5 ± 1.65 and 44.5 ± 2.2 g, respectively). Resting coronary blood flow in LAD and Cx was 55.0 ± 1.7 and 59.4 ± 1 ml/min, respectively. These data indicate that chemical activation of sensory endings with vagal afferents in the inferoposterior left ventricle of the dog results in larger cardioinhibitor and vasodepressor responses than result from activation of receptors in the anterior left ventricle.

  {"id":"Walker2020","abstract":"Circadian rhythms are internal manifestations of the solar day that permit adaptations to predictable environmental temporal changes. These ~24-h rhythms are controlled by molecular clockworks within the brain that are reset daily to precisely 24 h by exposure to the light–dark cycle. Information from the master clock in the mammalian hypothalamus conveys temporal information to the entire body via humoral and neural communication. A bidirectional relationship exists between mood disorders and circadian rhythms. Mood disorders are often associated with disrupted circadian clock-controlled responses, such as sleep and cortisol secretion, whereas disruption of circadian rhythms via jet lag, night-shift work, or exposure to artificial light at night, can precipitate or exacerbate affective symptoms in susceptible individuals. Evidence suggests strong associations between circadian rhythms and mental health, but only recently have studies begun to discover the direct interactions between the circadian system and mood regulation. This review provides an overview of disrupted circadian rhythms and the relationship to behavioral health and psychiatry. The focus of this review is delineating the role of disruption of circadian rhythms on mood disorders using human night shift studies, as well as jet lag studies to identify links. We also review animal models of disrupted circadian rhythms on affective responses. Lastly, we propose low-cost behavioral and lifestyle changes to improve circadian rhythms and presumably behavioral health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"William H."},{"family":"Walton","given":"James C."},{"family":"DeVries","given":"A.

  {"id":"Wallner2016","abstract":"© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.Rationale: Catecholamines increase cardiac contractility, but exposure to high concentrations or prolonged exposures can cause cardiac injury. A recent study demonstrated that a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (ISO; 200 mg/kg) in mice causes acute myocyte death (8%-10%) with complete cardiac repair within a month. Cardiac regeneration was via endogenous cKit+ cardiac stem cell-mediated new myocyte formation. Objective: Our goal was to validate this simple injury/regeneration system and use it to study the biology of newly forming adult cardiac myocytes. Methods and Results: C57BL/6 mice (n=173) were treated with single injections of vehicle, 200 or 300 mg/kg ISO, or 2 daily doses of 200 mg/kg ISO for 6 days. Echocardiography revealed transiently increased systolic function and unaltered diastolic function 1 day after single ISO injection. Single ISO injections also caused membrane injury in ≈10% of myocytes, but few of these myocytes appeared to be necrotic. Circulating troponin I levels after ISO were elevated, further documenting myocyte damage. However, myocyte apoptosis was not increased after ISO injury. Heart weight to body weight ratio and fibrosis were also not altered 28 days after ISO injection. Single- or multiple-dose ISO injury was not associated with an increase in the percentage of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine-labeled myocytes. Furthermore, ISO injections did not increase new myocytes in cKit+/Cre×R-GFP transgenic mice. Conclusions: A single dose of ISO causes injury in ≈10% of the cardiomyocytes. However, most of these myocytes seem to recover and do not elicit cKit+ cardiac stem cell-derived myocyte regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallner","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Jason M"},{"family":"Mohsin","given":"Sadia"},{"family":"Troupes","given":"Constantine D"},{"family":"Vanhoutte","given":"Davy"},{"family":"Borghetti","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Vagnozzi","given":"Ronald J"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Polina"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Daohai"},{"family":"Trappanese","given":"Danielle M"},{"family":"Kubo","given":"Hajime"},{"family":"Toib","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Thomas E"},{"family":"Harper","given":"Shavonn C"},{"family":"Volkert","given":"Michael A"},{"family":"Starosta","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Feldsott","given":"Eric A"},{"family":"Berretta","given":"Remus M"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Barbe","given":"Mary F"},{"family":"Molkentin","given":"Jeffrey D"},{"family":"Houser","given":"Steven R."}],"citation-key":"Wallner2016","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308687","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,16]]},"page":"865-879","PMID":"27461939","publisher":"NIH Public Access","title":"Acute Catecholamine Exposure Causes Reversible Myocyte Injury Without Cardiac Regeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461939","volume":"119"},
  {"id":"Walters2014","abstract":"Editorial Comment The relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent atrial flutter (AFL) has long been recognized in clinical practice. The development of both is favored by the presence of common triggers and substrate, particularly in the setting of structural heart disease with its attendant electrical and structural remodel-ing. Conditions associated with atrial remodeling, including heart failure, hypertension, increasing age and valvular heart disease, predispose to both fibrillation and flutter. The nature of the \"peri-tricuspid\" macroreentry circuit, constrained by structural and functional barriers to electrical propagation, is now well understood. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CTI-dependent AFL is most frequently preceded by a period of short cycle length atrial activation, and in particular by a period of AF. 1-4 Such activity induces regions of functional conduction block and slowed conduction that are necessary for the transition from multiple unstable wavefronts to a single organized circuit. 5,6 The development of functional conduction block along the crista terminalis seems particularly important in the patho-genesis of CTI-dependent AFL. 7-9 Thus the same pulmonary vein (PV) and non-PV triggers that initiate AF are also responsible , via transitional AF, for onset of the great majority of AFL episodes. This background is of prime importance when considering the accumulated literature evaluating the incidence of AF late after AFL ablation. This incidence is clearly time-dependent with reported rates of 17-22% at 6 months, increasing to 50% at 2 years and 63% at 4 years. 10,11 The most consistently identified risk factor for the development of post-ablation AF is documented pre-ablation AF, the prevalence of which varies according to the intensity of monitoring, 10-14 Other identified risk factors have included left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, 12,14 significant mitral regurgitation, 10 left atrial (LA) enlargement, 11,15 and the failure of multiple antiarrhyth-mic drugs (AADs). 14 All are associated with LA remodeling and an elevated risk of incident AF regardless of AFL abla-tion. Importantly, the incidence of AF after AFL ablation is also proportional to the intensity of monitoring. In a small study of patients who had loop recorders implanted after flutter ablation, 55% developed new AF within the first year of follow-up. 16 It seems probable that the variability in the reported incidence of post-ablation AF is related in large part to varying intensities of monitoring. In this issue of the Journal, Brembilla-Perrot and colleagues 17 further explore the incidence of and risk factors for AF following ablation of AFL. They present a large single-center series of 1,121 consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of CTI-dependent AFL, with data retrospectively extracted by chart review. A history of AF before AFL ablation was present in 31.8% of patients, but the nature of pre-ablation monitoring to determine this is not described. It is probable that the real AF incidence before ablation was much higher. Follow-up was continued for a mean of 2.1 ± 2.7 years, and included ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1 month but thereafter only at annual intervals or for investigation of symptoms. Using this approach, new AF was observed during follow-up in 19.3% of patients without pre-ablation AF, but ongoing AF was only detected in 31.5% of patients who did have pre-ablation AF. The study thus observed a fall in the overall AF incidence post-ablation (23.2%) compared with pre-ablation (31.8%), with a particularly marked fall in the group with AF before AFL ablation. This result should be viewed in the context of the limited post-ablation monitoring performed. Nevertheless, the ongoing involvement with the healthcare system remained significant with 8% developing permanent AF, 7% requiring electrical cardioversion, 7% atrio-ventricular node ablation and 15% pacemaker implantation. These data certainly make it difficult to argue that AFL ablation in this population provides a definitive result. Only AF history and female gender were significant pre-dictors of AF occurrence post-ablation. Other established markers of AF risk such as age, hypertension, diabetes and various forms of structural heart disease were not associated with post-ablation AF in this study. Importantly, at the time of ablation 50.5% had a CHADS 2 score 1 and although only 2 strokes occurred during follow-up both were in patients who were not anti-coagulated and who had AF recurrence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Walters","given":"Tomos E."},{"family":"Kalman","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"Walters2014","container-title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/jce.12446","ISSN":"15408167","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,1]]},"page":"821-823","PMID":"24762080","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Development of atrial fibrillation after atrial flutter ablation: More a question of when than whether","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/doi/full/10.1111/jce.12446","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"wang2008","abstract":"The neuroendocrine status of the brain has been linked to the quality of the aging process, to the risk of Alzheimer's disease and to progression of neurodegenerative pathology. Data from multiple levels of analysis ranging from in vitro cellular models to in vivo animal models to clinical investigations indicate that the decline of neurosteroids play a key role in successful aging and prevention of neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's. Among the neurosteroids in decline during aging is allopregnanolone (APalpha, a metabolite of progesterone, which is reduced in the serum, plasma and brain of aged vs. young subjects. Further, Alzheimer's disease (AD) victims exhibit an even greater reduction in plasma and brain levels of APalpha relative to age-matched neurologically normal controls. Our earlier work has shown that APalpha is a neurogenic agent for rodent hippocampal neural progenitors and for human neural progenitor cells derived from the cerebral cortex. Our ongoing research seeks to determine the neurogenic potential of APalpha in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3 x TgAD) as AD related pathology progresses from imperceptible to mild to severe. Initial analyses suggest that APalpha may maintain the regenerative ability of the brain, modify progression of AD related pathology and reverse learning and memory deficits in 3 x TgAD mice. This review summarizes current APalpha research in different animal models, neural progenitor regeneration within a degenerative milieu and the challenge for developing neuroregenerative therapeutics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jun Ming"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lifei"},{"family":"Irwin","given":"Ronald W"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shuhua"},{"family":"Brinton","given":"Roberta Diaz"}],"citation-key":"wang2008","container-title":"Brain Research Reviews","container-title-short":"Brain Res Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.08.010","ISSN":"0165-0173","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"page":"398-409","PMID":"17931704","source":"NCBI PubMed","title":"Regenerative potential of allopregnanolone","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.proxy.library.emory.edu/pubmed/17931704","volume":"57"},
  {"id":"Wang2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Stroke is common during the first few weeks after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China, we randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days) or to placebo plus aspirin (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1. The primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model, with study center as a random effect. RESULTS: Stroke occurred in 8.2% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, as compared with 11.7% of those in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.81; P<0.001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin group (P=0.73); the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3% in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for reducing the risk of stroke in the first 90 days and does not increase the risk of hemorrhage.

  {"id":"Wang2017a","abstract":"KEY POINTS Cardiac sympathetic afferents are considered to be essential pathways for transmission of cardiac nociception to the central nervous system during myocardial ischaemia. However, a potential contribution of the CSAR control of cardiac dysfunction in both normal and chronic heart failure (CHF) states remains unknown. We found that activation of the CSAR evokes little increase in cardiac contractility with an exaggerated peripheral vasoconstriction in the CHF state. CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine decreased cardiac contractility to a greater extent in CHF rats than sham rats. Furthermore, we also found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. Chronic ablation of the CSAR by epicardial application of the afferent neurotoxin, RTX, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure CHF rats. The observation suggests that CSAR has a differential effect on cardiac function in normal and CHF states. CSAR activation in normal state causes significant increase in cardiac contractility and cardiac output. ABSTRACT The enhanced 'cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex' (CSAR) critically contributes to the exaggerated global sympathetic tone in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, a potential contribution of the cardio-cardiac reflex control of cardiac function in both normal and CHF states remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of direct activation or inhibition of the CSAR on cardiac function by pressure-volume (P-V) loop analysis in ∼12-week sham-operated and myocardial infarcted (MI) rats. In sham rats, acute CSAR activation by epicardial application of bradykinin (BK) increased heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximum first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dtmax ), and the slope of the end-systolic P-V relationship (ESPVR), suggesting that acute CSAR activation in the normal state enhances myocardial contractility. CSAR activation also decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic volumes with little effect on LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or the end-diastolic P-V relationship (EDPVR) in sham rats. Compared to sham, CHF rats exhibit a reduced increase in the slope of the ESPVR and dp/dtmax in response to BK, indicating a poor contractile response to CSAR activation. Interestingly, BK application in CHF rats increased cardiac systolic and diastolic volumes and further increased the elevated LVEDP, neither of which was seen in sham rats. Following CSAR inhibition by epicardial lidocaine, blood pressure, HR, LVSP, dp/dt, LVEDP and ESPVR decreased in CHF rats whereas lidocaine had little effect in sham rats, indicating that the CSAR is tonically active in CHF and contributes to cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, we found that epicardial lidocaine paradoxically decreased LV end-diastolic volume (preload) in CHF rats, which was not observed in sham rats. The decreased preload by lidocaine in CHF rats may be due to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance since epicardial lidocaine significantly lowered peripheral (renal) sympathetic nerve activity in CHF rats but not in sham rats. Furthermore, chronic ablation of CSAR by epicardial application of a selective afferent neurotoxin, resiniferatoxin, selectively lowered diastolic blood pressure both at daytime and night-time with less effect on systolic blood pressure in CHF rats. Our data suggest that there is an imbalance between cardiac and peripheral responses to CSAR in CHF animals compared to sham-operated controls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Han Jun"},{"family":"Rozanski","given":"George J"},{"family":"Zucker","given":"Irving H"}],"citation-key":"Wang2017a","container-title":"Journal of Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/JP273764","ISSN":"14697793","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"2519-2534","title":"Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex control of cardiac function in normal and chronic heart failure states","type":"article-journal","volume":"595"},

This review seeks to highlight the necessity of investing in non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and how NIPD would improve patient safety and detection rate as well as allowing detection earlier in pregnancy. Non invasive prenatal diagnosis can take either a proteomics approach or nucleic acid-based approach; this review focuses on the latter. Since the discovery of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) and fetal RNA in maternal plasma, procedures have been developed for detection for monogenic traits and for some have become well established (e.g., RHD blood group status). However, NIPD of aneuploidies remains technically challenging. This review examines currently published literature evaluating techniques and approaches that have been suggested and developed for aneuploidy detection, highlighting their advantages and limitations and areas for further research.","author":[{"family":"Webb","given":"A"},{"family":"Madgett","given":"Te"},{"family":"Miran","given":"T"},{"family":"Sillence","given":"K"},{"family":"Kaushik","given":"N"},{"family":"Kiernan","given":"M"},{"family":"Avent","given":"Nd"}],"citation-key":"webb2012","container-title":"Balkan journal of medical genetics: BJMG","container-title-short":"Balkan J.

  {"id":"Wei2014","abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Depression is an adverse prognostic factor after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), and an increased propensity toward emotionally-driven myocardial ischemia may play a role. We aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in young survivors of an MI.\\n\\nMETHODS: We studied 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 38-60 years who were hospitalized for acute MI in the previous 6 months. Patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, after mental stress (speech task), and after exercise or pharmacological stress. A summed difference score (SDS), obtained with observer-independent software, was used to quantify myocardial ischemia under both stress conditions. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to measure depressive symptoms, which were analyzed as overall score, and as separate somatic and cognitive depressive symptom scores.\\n\\nRESULTS: There was a significant positive association between depressive symptoms and SDS with mental stress, denoting more ischemia. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, disease severity and medications, each incremental depressive symptom was associated with 0.14 points higher SDS. When somatic and cognitive depressive symptoms were examined separately, both somatic [β = 0.17, 95% CI: (0.04, 0.30), p = 0.01] and cognitive symptoms [β = 0.31, 95% CI: (0.07, 0.56), p = 0.01] were significantly associated with mental stress-induced ischemia. Depressive symptoms were not associated with ischemia induced by exercise or pharmacological stress.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Among young post-MI patients, higher levels of both cognitive and somatic depressive symptoms are associated with a higher propensity to develop myocardial ischemia with mental stress, but not with physical (exercise or pharmacological) stress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Jingkai"},{"family":"Pimple","given":"Pratik"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Amit J."},{"family":"Rooks","given":"Cherie"},{"family":"Bremner","given":"J.

  {"id":"Wei2014a","abstract":"Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) has been associated with adverse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether this is a uniform finding across different studies has not been described. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the association between MSIMI and adverse outcome events in patients with stable CAD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for English language prospective studies of patients with CAD who underwent standardized mental stress testing to determine presence of MSIMI and were followed up for subsequent cardiac events or total mortality. Our outcomes of interest were CAD recurrence, CAD mortality, or total mortality. A summary effect estimate was derived using a fixed-effects meta-analysis model. Only 5 studies, each with a sample size of <200 patients and fewer than 50 outcome events, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled samples comprised 555 patients with CAD (85% male) and 117 events with a range of follow-up from 35 days to 8.8 years. Pooled analysis showed that MSIMI was associated with a twofold increased risk of a combined end point of cardiac events or total mortality (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 3.15). No heterogeneity was detected among the studies (Q = 0.39, I2= 0.0%, p = 0.98). In conclusion, although few selected studies have examined the association between MSIMI and adverse events in patients with CAD, all existing investigations point to approximately a doubling of risk. Whether this increased risk is generalizable to the CAD population at large and varies in patient subgroups warrant further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"Weitz2017","abstract":"Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboem- bolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups. The authors’ full names, academic de- grees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

  {"id":"Welch2014","abstract":"Background-Constrictive pericarditis is a potentially reversible cause of heart failure that may be diffcult to differentiate from restrictive myocardial disease and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Echocardiography provides an important opportunity to evaluate for constrictive pericarditis, and defnite diagnostic criteria are needed. Methods and Results-Patients with surgically confrmed constrictive pericarditis (n=130) at Mayo Clinic (2008-2010) were compared with patients (n=36) diagnosed with restrictive myocardial disease or severe tricuspid regurgitation after constrictive pericarditis was considered but ruled out. Comprehensive echocardiograms were reviewed in blinded fashion. Five principal echocardiographic variables were selected based on prior studies and potential for clinical use: (1) respiration-related ventricular septal shift, (2) variation in mitral infow E velocity, (3) medial mitral annular e' velocity, (4) ratio of medial mitral annular e' to lateral e', and (5) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio. All 5 principal variables differed signifcantly between the groups. In patients with atrial fbrillation or futter (n=29), all but mitral infow velocity remained signifcantly different. Three variables were independently associated with constrictive pericarditis: (1) ventricular septal shift, (2) medial mitral e', and (3) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio. The presence of ventricular septal shift in combination with either medial e'≥9 cm/s or hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio ≥0.79 corresponded to a desirable combination of sensitivity (87%) and specifcity (91%). The specifcity increased to 97% when all 3 factors were present, but the sensitivity decreased to 64%. Conclusions-Echocardiography allows differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive myocardial disease and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Respiration-related ventricular septal shift, preserved or increased medial mitral annular e' velocity, and prominent hepatic vein expiratory diastolic fow reversals are independently associated with the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","author":[{"family":"Welch","given":"Terrence D."},{"family":"Ling","given":"Lieng H."},{"family":"Espinosa","given":"Raul E."},{"family":"Anavekar","given":"Nandan S."},{"family":"Wiste","given":"Heather J."},{"family":"Lahr","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Schaff","given":"Hartzell V."},{"family":"Oh","given":"Jae K."}],"citation-key":"Welch2014","container-title":"Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.113.001613","ISSN":"19420080","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"526-534","PMID":"24633783","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","title":"Echocardiographic diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis Mayo Clinic criteria","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"White2014","abstract":"Objectives This study tested the diagnostic and prognostic utility of a rapid, visual T1 assessment method for identification of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) in a \"real-life\" referral population undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance for suspected CA. Background In patients with confirmed CA, delayed-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) frequently shows a diffuse, global hyperenhancement (HE) pattern. However, imaging is often technically challenging, and the prognostic significance of diffuse HE is unclear. Methods Ninety consecutive patients referred for suspected CA and 64 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were prospectively enrolled and underwent a modified DE-CMR protocol. After gadolinium administration a method for rapid, visual T1 assessment was used to identify the presence of diffuse HE during the scan, allowing immediate optimization of settings for the conventional DE-CMR that followed. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Results Among patients with suspected CA, 66% (59 of 90) demonstrated HE, with 81% (48 of 59) of these meeting pre-specified visual T1 assessment criteria for diffuse HE. Among hypertensive LVH patients, 6% (4 of 64) had HE, with none having diffuse HE. During 29 months of follow-up (interquartile range: 12 to 44 months), there were 50 (56%) deaths in patients with suspected CA and 4 (6%) in patients with hypertensive LVH. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of diffuse HE was the most important predictor of death in the group with suspected CA (hazard ratio: 5.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.7 to 11.0; p < 0.0001) and in the population as a whole (hazard ratio: 6.0, 95% confidence interval 3.0 to 12.1; p < 0.0001). Among 25 patients with myocardial histology obtained during follow-up, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diffuse HE in the diagnosis of CA were 93%, 70%, and 84%, respectively.

  {"id":"White2019","abstract":"Objectives: This study was performed to evaluate an additional echocardiographic spectral Doppler marker, which would identify severe aortic stenosis (AS). Background: Echocardiography is most commonly utilized to assess AS and has been validated against invasive measurements. However, the data obtained are not always in agreement, leaving a conundrum regarding the true severity of AS and can lead to other diagnostic procedures. This highlights the importance of improved noninvasive diagnostic techniques. Methods: Forty-eight indeterminate cases of calcific AS that had been previously evaluated by both echocardiography and cardiac catheterization were included in the study, using cardiac catheterization as the gold standard for calculation of aortic valve area (AVA). The intensity of opening and closing of the aortic valve, represented by bright vertical deflections on the CW spectral waveform, was quantified using ImageJ software to generate pixel intensity histograms to create opening and closing click (OC and CC) ratios. These ratios were compared with echocardiographic variables and catheterization AVA. Results: Thirty-five patients were found to have severe AS and 13 patients were found to have nonsevere AS, as assessed by cardiac catheterization. CC ratio was found to be a significant predictor of severe AS with an OR 0.024 (95% CI: 0.002-0.378, P =.0079). Adding CC to a model using standard echocardiographic parameters resulted in significant improvement in the C-statistic (0.693 to 0.835, P =.0134). Conclusions: An additional Doppler marker measuring the aortic valve CC ratio has been found to improve detection of severe AS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Brent"},{"family":"Wessel","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Weili"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Sovari","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Konda","given":"Sreenivas"},{"family":"Frazin","given":"Leon"}],"citation-key":"White2019","container-title":"Echocardiography","DOI":"10.1111/echo.14541","ISSN":"15408175","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"page":"2158-2166","PMID":"31769078","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Quantitative analysis of spectral Doppler clicks in assessment of aortic stenosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.cc.uic.edu/doi/full/10.1111/echo.14541","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"Whitlock2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage has been hypothesized to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but this has not been proved. The procedure can be performed during cardiac surgery undertaken for other reasons. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving participants with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk of stroke) who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for another indication. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging) or systemic embolism. The participants, research personnel, and primary care physicians (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. RESULTS The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group, with a mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.2. The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P = 0.001). The incidence of perioperative bleeding, heart failure, or death did not differ significantly between the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS Among participants with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.

Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. OBJECTIVE: To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence. DATA SOURCES: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies). RESULTS: The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1-250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8-46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5-38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein >0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH >0.6, or pleural fluid LDH >two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08-1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06-5.3). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.","author":[{"family":"Wilcox","given":"M.

  {"id":"Wilcox2020","abstract":"Reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and recovery of LV function are associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A growing body of evidence suggests that even among patients who experience a complete normalization of LV ejection fraction, a significant proportion will develop recurrent LV dysfunction accompanied by recurrent heart failure events. This has led to intense interest in understanding how to manage patients with heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecEF). Because of the lack of a standard definition for HFrecEF, and the paucity of clinical data with respect to the natural history of HFrecEF patients, there are no current guidelines on how these patients should be followed up and managed. Accordingly, this JACC Scientific Expert Panel reviews the biology of reverse LV remodeling and the clinical course of patients with HFrecEF, as well as provides guidelines for defining, diagnosing, and managing patients with HFrecEF.","author":[{"family":"Wilcox","given":"Jane E."},{"family":"Fang","given":"James C."},{"family":"Margulies","given":"Kenneth B."},{"family":"Mann","given":"Douglas L."}],"citation-key":"Wilcox2020","container-title":"Journal of the American College of Cardiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.075","ISSN":"15583597","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"719-734","PMID":"32762907","title":"Heart Failure With Recovered Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: JACC Scientific Expert Panel","type":"article-journal","volume":"76"},
  {"id":"Wilkins1988","abstract":"Twenty two patients (four men, 18 women, mean age 56 years, range 21 to 88 years) with a history ofrheumatic mitral stenosis were studied by cross sectional echocardiography before and after balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. The appearance of the mitral valve on the predilatation echocardiogram was scored for leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvar thickening, and calcification. Mitral valve area, left atrial volume, transmitral pressure difference, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, cardiac rhythm, New York Heart Association functional class, age, and sex were also studied. Because there was some increase in valve area in almost all patients the results were classified as optimal or suboptimal (final valve area <1.0 cm2 final left atrial pressure > 10 mm Hg, or final valve area < 25% greater than the initial area). The best multiple logistic regression fit was found with the total echocardiographic score alone. Ahigh score (advanced leaflet deformity) was associated with a suboptimal outcome while a low score (a mobile valve with limited thickening) was associated with an optimal outcome. No other haemodynamic or clinical variables emerged as predictors of outcome in this analysis. Examination of pre-dilatation and post-dilatation echocardiograms showed that balloon dilatation reliably resulted in cleavage of the commissural plane and thus an increase in valve area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkins","given":"Gerard T."},{"family":"Weyman","given":"Arthur E."},{"family":"Abascal","given":"Vivian M."},{"family":"Block","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Igor F."}],"citation-key":"Wilkins1988","container-title":"Heart","DOI":"10.1136/hrt.60.4.299","ISSN":"13556037","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"299-308","PMID":"3190958","publisher":"Br Heart J","title":"Percutaneous balloon dilatation of the mitral valve: An analysis of echocardiographic variables related to outcome and the mechanism of dilatation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3190958/","volume":"60"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined prospectively the association between trait anger and the risk of combined CHD (acute myocardial infarction [MI]/fatal CHD, silent MI, or cardiac revascularization procedures) and of \"hard\" events (acute MI/fatal CHD). Participants were 12 986 black and white men and womenenrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study. In the entire cohort, individuals with high trait anger, compared with their low anger counterparts, were at increased risk of CHD in both event categories. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) was 1.54 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.16) for combined CHD and 1.75 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.64) for \"hard\" events. Heterogeneity of effect was observed by hypertensive status. Among normotensive individuals, the risk of combined CHD and of \"hard\" events increased monotonically with increasing levels of trait anger.

CHD event-free survival among normotensives who had a strong, angry temperament was not significantly different from that of hypertensives at either level of anger. These data suggest that a strong, angry temperament rather than anger in reaction to criticism, frustration, or unfair treatment places normotensive, middle-aged persons at increased risk for cardiac events and may confer a CHD risk similar to that of hypertension.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Janice E"},{"family":"Nieto","given":"F Javier"},{"family":"Sanford","given":"Catherine P"},{"family":"Tyroler","given":"Herman A"}],"citation-key":"Williams2001","container-title":"American Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/aje/154.3.230","ISSN":"00029262","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"230-235","title":"Effects of an angry temperament on coronary heart disease risk: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/154/3/230/125813","volume":"154"},

We sought to determine the frequency of this complication in the STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) database as well as the outcomes of patients who suffer intraoperative aortic dissection. We then developed a model to identify preoperative characteristics and intraoperative factors associated with the complication. Methods: All patients from the STS database who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve surgery, or mitral valve surgery were included. Exclusion criteria included any patient who had aortic dissection listed as a reason for urgent or emergent operation. Data collected were then analyzed to describe the frequency of aortic dissection as a complication as well as its consequences. We then analyzed a more recent era that included information on arterial cannulation site (femoral-other versus aortic) to identify risk factors for aortic dissection. Results: Of 2,219,991 patients analyzed, 1,294 suffered aortic dissection as a complication of their surgery, for an incidence of 0.06%. This complication frequently led to catastrophic results, with 615 of 1,294 (48%) operative mortality. A logistic regression model was created based on 2004 to 2007 STS data. Of 680,025 patients analyzed, 436 patients suffered an aortic dissection. The analysis yielded nine significant risk factors including femoral arterial cannulation, preoperative steroids, and Asian race; the presence of diabetes appeared to be protective.

We examined the predictive value of vital exhaustion for incident myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease in middle-aged men and women in 4 US communities. Participants were 12,895 black or white men and women enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study cohort and followed for the occurrence of cardiac morbidity and mortality from 1990 through 2002 (maximum follow-up 13.0 years). Vital exhaustion was assessed using the 21-item Maastricht Questionnaire and scores were partitioned into approximate quartiles for statistical analyses. High vital exhaustion (fourth quartile) predicted adverse cardiac events in age-, gender-, and race-center-adjusted analyses (1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.05) and in analyses further adjusted for educational level, body mass index, plasma low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, and pack-years of cigarette smoking (1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.79). Risk for adverse cardiac events increased monotonically from the first through the fourth quartile of vital exhaustion. Probabilities of adverse cardiac events over time were significantly higher in people with high vital exhaustion compared to those with low exhaustion (p = 0.002).

  {"id":"Williams2015","abstract":"Unlike their terrestrial ancestors, marine mammals routinely confront extreme physiological and physical challenges while breath-holding and pursuing prey at depth. To determine how cetaceans and pinnipeds accomplish deep-sea chases, we deployed animal-borne instruments that recorded high-resolution electrocardiograms, behaviour and flipper accelerations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) diving from the surface to >200 m. Here we report that both exercise and depth alter the bradycardia associated with the dive response, with the greatest impacts at depths inducing lung collapse. Unexpectedly, cardiac arrhythmias occurred in >73% of deep, aerobic dives, which we attribute to the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic drivers for exercise and diving, respectively. Such marked cardiac variability alters the common view of a stereotypic ‘dive reflex’ in diving mammals. It also suggests the persistence of ancestral terrestrial traits in cardiac function that may help explain the unique sensitivity of some deep-diving marine mammals to anthropogenic disturbances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Terrie M."},{"family":"Fuiman","given":"Lee A."},{"family":"Kendall","given":"Traci"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Beau"},{"family":"Noren","given":"Shawn R."},{"family":"Thometz","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Shattock","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Farrell","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Stamper","given":"Andy M."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Randall W."}],"citation-key":"Williams2015","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms7055","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,16]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"6055","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Exercise at depth alters bradycardia and incidence of cardiac anomalies in deep-diving marine mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7055","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"Williams2021","abstract":"Background: Electroanatomic mapping systems are used to support electrophysiology research. Data exported from these systems is stored in proprietary formats which are challenging to access and storage-space inefficient. No previous work has made available an open-source platform for parsing and interrogating this data in a standardized format. We therefore sought to develop a standardized, open-source data structure and associated computer code to store electroanatomic mapping data in a space-efficient and easily accessible manner. Methods: A data structure was defined capturing the available anatomic and electrical data. OpenEP, implemented in MATLAB, was developed to parse and interrogate this data. Functions are provided for analysis of chamber geometry, activation mapping, conduction velocity mapping, voltage mapping, ablation sites, and electrograms as well as visualization and input/output functions. Performance benchmarking for data import and storage was performed. Data import and analysis validation was performed for chamber geometry, activation mapping, voltage mapping and ablation representation. Finally, systematic analysis of electrophysiology literature was performed to determine the suitability of OpenEP for contemporary electrophysiology research. Results: The average time to parse clinical datasets was 400 ± 162 s per patient. OpenEP data was two orders of magnitude smaller than compressed clinical data (OpenEP: 20.5 ± 8.7 Mb, vs clinical: 1.46 ± 0.77 Gb). OpenEP-derived geometry metrics were correlated with the same clinical metrics (Area: R2 = 0.7726, P < 0.0001; Volume: R2 = 0.5179, P < 0.0001). Investigating the cause of systematic bias in these correlations revealed OpenEP to outperform the clinical platform in recovering accurate values. Both activation and voltage mapping data created with OpenEP were correlated with clinical values (mean voltage R2 = 0.8708, P < 0.001; local activation time R2 = 0.8892, P < 0.0001). OpenEP provides the processing necessary for 87 of 92 qualitatively assessed analysis techniques (95%) and 119 of 136 quantitatively assessed analysis techniques (88%) in a contemporary cohort of mapping studies. Conclusions: We present the OpenEP framework for evaluating electroanatomic mapping data. OpenEP provides the core functionality necessary to conduct electroanatomic mapping research. We demonstrate that OpenEP is both space-efficient and accurately representative of the original data. We show that OpenEP captures the majority of data required for contemporary electroanatomic mapping-based electrophysiology research and propose a roadmap for future development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Roney","given":"Caroline H."},{"family":"Connolly","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Sim","given":"Iain"},{"family":"Whitaker","given":"John"},{"family":"O’Hare","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kotadia","given":"Irum"},{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Louisa"},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Cesare"},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Niederer","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Matt"},{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Linton","given":"Nick W.F."}],"citation-key":"Williams2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","DOI":"10.3389/FPHYS.2021.646023/BIBTEX","ISSN":"1664042X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,26]]},"page":"160","publisher":"Frontiers Media S.A.","title":"OpenEP: A Cross-Platform Electroanatomic Mapping Data Format and Analysis Platform for Electrophysiology Research","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"Wilson2007","abstract":"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Dodd"}],"citation-key":"Wilson2007","container-title":"Clinical methods: the history, physical, and laboratory examinations","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004","ISBN":"9788578110796","ISSN":"1098-6596","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"439-442","PMID":"25246403","title":"Hematemesis, Melena, and Hematochezia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21250251"},

The median daily rate of PAF was 1.21 episodes per day (interquartile range [IQR] 0.31-4.99), and the median maximum duration per individual was 7.5 hours (IQR 2.4-18.6 hours). There was an inverse relationship between the duration of PAF episodes and the frequency in which they occurred, which became pronounced at moderate and high overall burdens of AF. This produced a spectrum of PAF flanked by 2 distinct subtypes of the disease: the staccato subtype, characterized by many, short AF episodes; and the legato subtype, characterized by fewer, longer episodes. Longer but less frequent episodes became more common with increasing age. Only 49.4% of individuals experienced an episode in the first 24 hours of monitoring, increasing to 89.7% after 1 week of monitoring.\nCONCLUSION: We identified subtypes of the disease that we labeled staccato and legato. Although further study is required, these subtypes may result from differing elements of pathophysiology and disease progression, and may confer differing stroke risks.","author":[{"family":"Wineinger","given":"Nathan E."},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Paddy M."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yunyue"},{"family":"Irfanullah","given":"Ikram"},{"family":"Muse","given":"Evan D."},{"family":"Steinhubl","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Topol","given":"Eric J."}],"citation-key":"Wineinger2019","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","container-title-short":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2018.08.012","ISSN":"1556-3871","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"26-30","PMCID":"PMC6800237","PMID":"30118885","source":"PubMed","title":"Identification of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation subtypes in over 13,000 individuals","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},

The aim was to establish the viability of using an in vitro model to investigate the effects of left and right sympathetic chain stimulation (LSS/RSS). For this purpose the upper sympathetic chain on each side was isolated and bipolar stimulating electrodes were attached between T2-T3 and electrically insulated from surrounding tissue in a Langendorff innervated rabbit heart preparation (n = 8). Heart rate (HR) was investigated during sinus rhythm, whilst dromotropic, inotropic and ventricular electrophysiological effects were measured during constant pacing (250. bpm). All responses exhibited linear increases with increases in stimulation frequency (2-10. Hz). The change in HR was larger during RSS than LSS (P. <. 0.01), increasing by 78. ±. 9. bpm and 49. ±. 8. bpm respectively (10. Hz, baseline; 145. ±. 7. bpm). Left ventricular pressure was increased from a baseline of 50. ±. 4. mm. Hg, by 22. ±. 5. mm. Hg (LSS, 10. Hz) and 4. ±. 1. mm. Hg (RSS, 10. Hz) respectively (P. <. 0.001). LSS, but not RSS, caused a shortening of basal and apical monophasic action potential duration (MAPD90). We demonstrate that RSS exerts a greater effect at the sinoatrial node and LSS at the left ventricle.

  {"id":"Winter2018","abstract":"Rationale: Arrhythmogenic cardiac alternans are thought to be an important determinant for the initiation of ventricular fibrillation. There is limited information on the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) on alternans in the intact heart and the conclusions of existing studies, focused on investigating electrical alternans, are conflicted. Meanwhile, several lines of evidence implicate instabilities in Ca handling, not electrical restitution, as the primary mechanism underpinning alternans. Despite this, there have been no studies on Ca alternans and SNS in the intact heart. The present study sought to address this, by application of voltage and Ca optical mapping for the simultaneous study of APD and Ca alternans in the intact guinea pig heart during direct SNS., Objective: To determine the effects of SNS on APD and Ca alternans in the intact guinea pig heart and to examine the mechanism(s) by which the effects of SNS are mediated., Methods and Results: Studies utilized simultaneous voltage and Ca optical mapping in isolated guinea pig hearts with intact innervation. Alternans were induced using a rapid dynamic pacing protocol. SNS was associated with rate-independent shortening of action potential duration (APD) and the suppression of APD and Ca alternans, as indicated by a shift in the alternans threshold to faster pacing rates. Qualitatively similar results were observed with exogenous noradrenaline perfusion. In contrast with previous reports, both SNS and noradrenaline acted to flatten the slope of the electrical restitution curve. Pharmacological block of the slow delayed rectifying potassium current (IKs), sufficient to abolish IKs-mediated APD-adaptation, partially reversed the effects of SNS on pacing-induced alternans. Treatment with cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPase, had opposite effects to that of SNS, acting to increase susceptibility to alternans, and suggesting that accelerated Ca reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a major mechanism by which SNS suppresses alternans in the guinea pig heart., Conclusions: SNS suppresses calcium and action potential alternans in the intact guinea pig heart by an action mediated through accelerated Ca handling and via increased IKs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Winter","given":"James"},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Martin J."},{"family":"Wilder","given":"Catherine D.

DESIGN AND METHODS One hundred eighteen healthy young women provided data on ACEs and underwent psychosocial stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, quantified by high-frequency HR variability) were assessed as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. A mediation model was calculated to test the indirect effects of ACEs on HR via SBP and RSA. RESULTS The effect of ACEs on HR reactivity was mediated by SBP reactivity but not by RSA reactivity. ACEs were associated with reduced SBP at rest. CONCLUSIONS ACEs were associated with down-regulation in a measure of sympathetic but no alteration in a measure of parasympathetic cardiovascular stress reactivity in adulthood.

  {"id":"Wolder2023","abstract":"Background: The electrocardiographic (ECG) marker P terminal force V1 (PTFV1) is generally perceived as a marker of left atrial pathology and has been associated with atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF). Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between PTFV1 components (duration and amplitude) and incident AF and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: The study included patients with an ECG recorded at the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory in 2001 to 2011. PTFV1 ≥4 mV·ms was considered abnormal. Patients with abnormal PTFV1 were stratified into tertiles based on duration (PTDV1) and amplitude (PTAV1) values. Cox regressions adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities were used to investigate associations between abnormal PTFV1 components and AF and stroke/TIA. Results: Of 267,636 patients, 5803 had AF and 18,176 had stroke/TIA (follow-up 6.5 years). Abnormal PTFV1 was present in 44,549 subjects (16.7%) and was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Among patients with abnormal PTFV1, the highest tertile of PTDV1 (78–97 ms) was associated with the highest risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–1.52) and highest risk of stroke/TIA (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05 –1.20). For PTAV1, the highest tertile (78–126 μV) conferred the highest risk of AF and stroke/TIA (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09–1.32; and HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.14–1.25, respectively). Conclusion: Abnormal PTFV1 was associated with an increased risk of AF and stroke/TIA. Increasing PTDV1 showed a dose–response relationship with the development of AF and stroke/TIA, whereas the association between PTAV1 and AF was less apparent.","author":[{"family":"Wolder","given":"Lecia Dixen"},{"family":"Graff","given":"Claus"},{"family":"Baadsgaard","given":"Kirstine H."},{"family":"Langgaard","given":"Monica Lykke"},{"family":"Polcwiartek","given":"Christoffer"},{"family":"Ji-Young Lee","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Skov","given":"Morten Wagner"},{"family":"Torp-Pedersen","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Atwater","given":"Brett"},{"family":"Overvad","given":"Thure Filskov"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Jonas Bille"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Steen Moeller"},{"family":"Sogaard","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kragholm","given":"Kristian H."}],"citation-key":"Wolder2023","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.11.010","ISSN":"15563871","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"page":"354-362","PMID":"36435351","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Electrocardiographic P terminal force in lead V1, its components, and the association with stroke and atrial fibrillation or flutter","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

We constructed Poincaré plots of each sinus R-R interval plotted against the subsequent R-R interval from 24-hour Holter recordings of 24 healthy subjects (control group) and 24 patients with heart failure. Every subject in the control group had a comet-shaped Poincaré plot resulting from an increase in beat-to-beat dispersion as heart rate slowed. No patient with heart failure had this comet-shaped pattern. Instead, three distinctive patterns were identified: (1) a torpedo-shaped pattern resulting from low R-R interval dispersion over the entire range of heart rates, (2) a fanshaped pattern resulting from restriction of overall R-R interval ranges with enhanced dispersion, and (3) complex patterns with clusters of points characteristic of stepwise changes in R-R intervals. Poincaré pattern could not be predicted from standard deviations of R-R intervals. This first use of Poincaré plots in heart rate variability analysis reveals a complexity not readily perceived from standard deviation information.

Statistical power of GWAS depends on the genetic architecture of phenotype, sample size, and study design.

In this paper, we derive the statistical power distribution across causal SNPs under the assumption of a point-normal effect size distribution. We demonstrate how key outcome indices of GWAS are related to the genetic architecture (heritability and polygenicity) of the phenotype through the power distribution. We also provide a fast, flexible and interactive power calculation tool which generates predictions for key GWAS outcomes including the number of independent significant SNPs, the phenotypic variance explained by these SNPs, and the predictive accuracy of resulting polygenic scores. These results could also be used to explore the future behaviour of GWAS as sample sizes increase further.

  {"id":"Wunnemann2019","abstract":"Background:\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) represents one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the healthcare risks and societal impacts associated with CAD, their clinical management would benefit from improved prevention and prediction tools. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on an individual’s genome sequence are emerging as potentially powerful biomarkers to predict the risk to develop CAD. Two recently derived genome-wide PRS have shown high specificity and sensitivity to identify CAD cases in European-ancestry participants from the UK Biobank. However, validation of the PRS predictive power and transferability in other populations is now required to support their clinical utility.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe calculated both PRS (GPSCAD and metaGRSCAD) in French-Canadian individuals from 3 cohorts totaling 3639 prevalent CAD cases and 7382 controls and tested their power to predict prevalent, incident, and recurrent CAD. We also estimated the impact of the founder French-Canadian familial hypercholesterolemia deletion (LDLR delta >15 kb deletion) on CAD risk in one of these cohorts and used this estimate to calibrate the impact of the PRS.\n\nResults:\n\nOur results confirm the ability of both PRS to predict prevalent CAD comparable to the original reports (area under the curve=0.72–0.89). Furthermore, the PRS identified about 6% to 7% of individuals at CAD risk similar to carriers of the LDLR delta >15 kb mutation, consistent with previous estimates. However, the PRS did not perform as well in predicting an incident or recurrent CAD (area under the curve=0.56–0.60), maybe because of confounding because 76% of the participants were on statin treatment. This result suggests that additional work is warranted to better understand how ascertainment biases and study design impact PRS for CAD.\n\nConclusions:\n\nCollectively, our results confirm that novel, genome-wide PRS is able to predict CAD in French Canadians; with further improvements, this is likely to pave the way towards more targeted strategies to predict and prevent CAD-related adverse events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wünnemann","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Sin Lo","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Langford-Avelar","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Busseuil","given":"David"},{"family":"Dubé","given":"Marie-Pierre"},{"family":"Tardif","given":"Jean-Claude"},{"family":"Lettre","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"Wunnemann2019","container-title":"Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002481","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6]]},"page":"e002481","publisher":"American Heart Association","source":"ahajournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Validation of Genome-Wide Polygenic Risk Scores for Coronary Artery Disease in French Canadians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002481","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"Xu2017","abstract":"Microparticles (MPs) are cell-cell communication vesicles derived from the cell surface plasma membrane, although they are not known to originate from cardiac ventricular muscle. In ventricular cardiomyocytes, the membrane deformation protein cardiac bridging integrator 1 (cBIN1 or BIN1+13+17) creates transverse-tubule (t-tubule) membrane microfolds, which facilitate ion channel trafficking and modulate local ionic concentrations. The microfold-generated microdomains continuously reorganize, adapting in response to stress to modulate the calcium signaling apparatus. We explored the possibility that cBIN1-microfolds are externally released from cardiomyocytes. Using electron microscopy imaging with immunogold labeling, we found in mouse plasma that cBIN1 exists in membrane vesicles about 200 nm in size, which is consistent with the size of MPs. In mice with cardiac-specific heterozygous Bin1 deletion, flow cytometry identified 47% less cBIN1-MPs in plasma, supporting cardiac origin. Cardiac release was also evidenced by the detection of cBIN1-MPs in medium bathing a pure population of isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In human plasma, osmotic shock increased cBIN1 detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cBIN1 level decreased in humans with heart failure, a condition with reduced cardiac muscle cBIN1, both of which support cBIN1 release in MPs from human hearts. Exploring putative mechanisms of MP release, we found that the membrane fission complex endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B) colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with cBIN1, an interaction enhanced by actin stabilization. In HeLa cells with cBIN1 overexpression, knockdown of CHMP4B reduced the release of cBIN1-MPs. Using truncation mutants, we identified that the N-terminal BAR (N-BAR) domain in cBIN1 is required for CHMP4B binding and MP release. This study links the BAR protein superfamily to the ESCRT pathway for MP biogenesis in mammalian cardiac ventricular cells, identifying elements of a pathway by which cytoplasmic cBIN1 is released into blood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Agvanian","given":"Sosse"},{"family":"Wirka","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Baum","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Robin M."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Ting Ting"}],"citation-key":"Xu2017","container-title":"PLoS Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.2002354","editor":[{"family":"Lo","given":"Cecilia"}],"ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"15457885","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,14]]},"page":"e2002354","PMID":"28806752","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"The ESCRT-III pathway facilitates cardiomyocyte release of cBIN1-containing microparticles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002354","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"Yamada2000","abstract":"A mathematical model was developed to analyze the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony during pressure support ventilation (PSV). Solving the model revealed several results. 1) Ratio of the flow at the end of patient neural inspiration to peak inspiratory flow (VTI/V(peak)) during PSV is determined by the ratio of time constant of the respiratory system (tau) to patient neural inspiratory time (TI) and the ratio of the set pressure support (Pps) level to maximal inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus max). 2) VTI/V(peak) is affected more by tau/TI than by Pps/Pmus max. VTI/V(peak) increases in a sigmoidal relationship to tau/TI. An increase in Pps/Pmus max slightly shifts the VTI/V(peak)-tau/TI curve to the right, i.e., VTI/V(peak) becomes lower as Pps/Pmus max increases at the same tau/TI. 3) Under the selected adult respiratory mechanics, VTI/V(peak) ranges from 1 to 85% and has an excellent linear correlation with tau/TI. 4) In mechanical ventilators, single fixed levels of the flow termination criterion will always have chances of both synchronized termination and asynchronized termination, depending on patient mechanics. An increase in tau/TI causes more delayed and less premature termination opportunities. An increase in Pps/Pmus max narrows the synchronized zone, making inspiratory termination predisposed to be in asynchrony. Increasing the expiratory trigger sensitivity of a ventilator shifts the synchronized zone to the right, causing less delayed and more premature termination. Automation of expiratory trigger sensitivity in future mechanical ventilators may also be possible.

  {"id":"Yaniv2014","abstract":"Background A reduction of complexity of heart beating interval variability that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease states is thought to derive from the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural impulses to the heart. However, rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) drives their beating, even in the absence of autonomic neural input. Objective To test how this rhythmic clocklike behavior intrinsic to pacemaker cells interacts with autonomic impulses to the heart beating interval variability in vivo. Methods We analyzed beating interval variability in time and frequency domains and by fractal and entropy analyses: (1) in vivo, when the brain input to the SAN is intact; (2) during autonomic denervation in vivo; (3) in isolated SAN tissue (ie, in which the autonomic neural input is completely absent); (4) in single pacemaker cells isolated from the SAN; and (5) after autonomic receptor stimulation of these cells. Results Spontaneous beating intervals of pacemaker cells residing in the isolated SAN tissue exhibit fractal-like behavior and have lower approximate entropy compared with those in the intact heart. Isolation of pacemaker cells from SAN tissue, however, leads to a loss in the beating interval order and fractal-like behavior. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation of isolated pacemaker cells increases intrinsic clock synchronization, decreases their action potential period, and increases system complexity. Conclusions Both the average beating interval in vivo and beating interval complexity are conferred by the combined effects of clock periodicity intrinsic to pacemaker cells and their response to autonomic neural input. © 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.","author":[{"family":"Yaniv","given":"Yael"},{"family":"Ahmet","given":"Ismayil"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Lyashkov","given":"Alexey E."},{"family":"Guiriba","given":"Toni Rose"},{"family":"Okamoto","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Ziman","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Lakatta","given":"Edward G."}],"citation-key":"Yaniv2014","container-title":"Heart Rhythm","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.03.049","ISSN":"15563871","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1210-1219","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Synchronization of sinoatrial node pacemaker cell clocks and its autonomic modulation impart complexity to heart beating intervals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.03.049","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"Yannopoulos2019","abstract":"Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70% to 85%. More than 90% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25% to 50%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10% to 15% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9% to 45% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Yannopoulos","given":"Demetris"},{"family":"Bartos","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Aufderheide","given":"Tom P."},{"family":"Callaway","given":"Clifton W."},{"family":"Deo","given":"Rajat"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Halperin","given":"Henry R."},{"family":"Kern","given":"Karl B."},{"family":"Kudenchuk","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Neumar","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Raveendran","given":"Ganesh"}],"citation-key":"Yannopoulos2019","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIR.0000000000000630","ISSN":"15244539","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,19]]},"page":"e530-e552","PMID":"30760026","publisher":"NLM (Medline)","title":"The Evolving Role of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory in the Management of Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ahajournals.org","volume":"139"},
  {"id":"Yanowitz1966","abstract":"Changes of the electrocardiogram and of ventricular refractory period were measured following either unilateral stellate ganglion stimulation or ablation in the open chest dog preparation. Right stellate ganglionectomy or left stellate stimulation produces prolonged Q-T intervals and increased T-wave amplitude. Left stellate ganglionectomy or right stellate stimulation produces increased T-wave negativity without measurable change in the Q-T interval. The differing patterns of electrocardiographic wave form resulting from changes in sympathetic tone mediated by right and left stellate innervation could be correlated with changes in ventricular refractory period. Following right stellate ganglionectomy, refractory period prolongations were most marked over the anterior ventricular surface; left stellate ganglionectomy produced the greatest prolongation on the posterior surface. Although the right and left stellate innervations of the ventricles overlap, the left stellate influence is predominant over the posterior wall of the ventricles, while right stellate influence dominates the anterior ventricular walls. The electrocardiographic form changes observed following unilateral alteration of sympathetic tone paralleled those electrocardiographic abnormalities seen in patients with lesions of the central nervous system, suggesting a possible functional explanation for these clinical findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Yanowitz","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Preston","given":"James B."},{"family":"Abildskov","given":"J.

The most frequently reported difficulties of problem residents were insufficient medical knowledge (48%), poor clinical judgment (44%), and inefficient use of time (44%). Stressors and depression were the most frequently identified underlying problems (42% and 24%, respectively). The most frequent processes by which problem residents were discovered included direct observation (82%) and critical incidents (59%). Chief residents and attending physicians most frequently identified problem residents (84% and 76%, respectively); problem residents rarely identified themselves (2%). Many program directors believed that residents who are from an underrepresented minority, are international medical graduates, or are older than 35 years are at increased risk of being identified as a problem resident (P&lt;.05).

  {"id":"Yao2018","abstract":"IMPORTANCE Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAAO) may be performed during concurrent cardiac surgery. However, few data exist on the association of LAAO with long-term risk of stroke, and some evidence suggests that this procedure may be associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of surgical LAAO performed during cardiac surgery with risk of stroke, mortality, and development of subsequent AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study using a large US administrative database that contains data from adult patients (18 years) with private insurance or Medicare Advantage who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or valve surgery between January 1, 2009, and March 30, 2017, with final follow-up on March 31, 2017. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to balance patients on 76 dimensions to compare those with vs without LAAO, stratified by history of prior AF at the time of surgery. EXPOSURES Surgical LAAO vs no surgical LAAO during cardiac surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were stroke (ie, ischemic stroke or systemic embolism) and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were postoperative AF (AF within 30 days after surgery among patients without prior AF) and long-term AF-related health utilization (event rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations). RESULTS Among 75 782 patients who underwent cardiac surgery (mean age, 66.0 [SD, 11.2] years; 2 2091 [29.2%] women, 25 721 [33.9%] with preexisting AF), 4374 (5.8%) underwent concurrent LAAO, and mean follow-up was 2.1 (SD, 1.9) years. In the 8590 propensity score–matched patients, LAAO was associated with a reduced risk of stroke (1.14 vs 1.59 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56-0.96]; P = .03) and mortality (3.01 vs 4.30 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.84]; P < .001). LAAO was associated with higher rates of AF-related outpatient visits (11.96 vs 10.26 events per person-year; absolute difference, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.60-1.80] events per person-year; rate ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.10-1.24]; P < .001) and hospitalizations (0.36 vs 0.32 event per person-year; absolute difference, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.02-0.06] event per person-year; rate ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05-1.21]; P = .002). In patients with prior AF (6438/8590 [74.9%]) with vs without LAAO, risk of stroke was 1.11 vs 1.71 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P = .01) and risk of mortality was 3.22 vs 4.93 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]; P < .001), respectively. In patients without prior AF (2152/8590 [25.1%]) with vs without LAAO, risk of stroke was 1.23 vs 1.26 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.54-1.68]), risk of mortality was 2.30 vs 2.49 events per 100 person-years (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.61-1.37]), and risk of postoperative AF was 27.7% vs 20.2% events per 100 person-years (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.73]; P < .001). The interaction term between prior AF and LAAO was not significant (P = .29 for stroke and P = .16 for mortality). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, concurrent surgical LAAO, compared with no surgical LAAO, was associated with reduced risk of subsequent stroke and all-cause mortality. Further research, including from randomized clinical trials, is needed to more definitively determine the role of surgical LAAO.","author":[{"family":"Yao","given":"Xiaoxi"},{"family":"Gersh","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Holmes","given":"David R."},{"family":"Melduni","given":"Rowlens M."},{"family":"Johnsrud","given":"Daniel O."},{"family":"Sangaralingham","given":"Lindsey R."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nilay D."},{"family":"Noseworthy","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"Yao2018","container-title":"JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2018.6024","ISSN":"15383598","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,22]]},"page":"2116-2126","PMID":"29800182","publisher":"American Medical Association","title":"Association of surgical left atrial appendage occlusion with subsequent stroke and mortality among patients undergoing cardiac surgery","type":"article-journal","volume":"319"},

Objectives This study assessed the predictive accuracy and improvement in reclassification gained by the addition of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and family history (FH) of ASCVD to the PCE in participants of MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Methods The PCE was calibrated (cPCE) and used for this analysis. The Cox proportional hazards survival model, Harrell's C statistics, and net reclassification improvement analyses were used. ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease-related death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Results Of 6,814 MESA participants not prescribed statins at baseline, 5,185 had complete data and were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 61 years; 53.1% were women, 9.8% had diabetes, and 13.6% were current smokers. After 10 years of follow-up, 320 (6.2%) ASCVD events occurred. CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events in the multivariable Cox models. CAC score modestly improved the Harrell's C statistic (0.74 vs. 0.76; p = 0.04); ABI, hsCRP levels, and FH produced no improvement in Harrell's C statistic when added to the cPCE. Conclusions CAC score, ABI, and FH were independent predictors of ASCVD events. CAC score modestly improved the discriminative ability of the cPCE compared with other nontraditional risk markers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yeboah","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Young","given":"Rebekah"},{"family":"McClelland","given":"Robyn L."},{"family":"Delaney","given":"Joseph C."},{"family":"Polonsky","given":"Tamar S."},{"family":"Dawood","given":"Farah Z."},{"family":"Blaha","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Miedema","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Sibley","given":"Christopher T."},{"family":"Carr","given":"J.

  {"id":"Yeragani2002","abstract":"Background: Studies have linked depression to sudden death and serious cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiac illness. Recent studies have shown decreased vagal function in cardiac patients with depression and depressed patients without cardiac illness. Methods: We compared 20-hour, sleeping, and awake heart period variability measures using spectral analysis, fractal dimension, and symbolic dynamics in two patient groups with major depression and ischemic heart disease (mean age 59-60 years) before and after 6 weeks of paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment. Results: Spectral measures showed decreases in awake and sleeping total power (TP: 0.0-0.5 Hz), ultra low frequency power (ULF: 0-0.0033 Hz), very low frequency power (VLF: 0.0033-0.04 Hz), and low-frequency power (LF: 0.04-0.15 Hz) for nortriptyline condition and a decrease in high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.5 Hz) for the awake condition in patients who received nortriptyline. A measure of nonlinear complexity, WC-100, significantly increased after paroxetine during the awake condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that nortriptyline has stronger vagolytic effects on cardiac autonomic function compared with paroxetine, which is in agreement with previous clinical and preclinical reports.

  {"id":"Yoneda2021","abstract":"Importance: Early-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) can be the initial manifestation of a more serious underlying inherited cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndrome. Objective: To examine the results of genetic testing for early-onset AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled participants from an academic medical center who had AF diagnosed before 66 years of age and underwent whole genome sequencing through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. Participants were enrolled from November 23, 1999, to June 2, 2015. Data analysis was performed from October 24, 2020, to March 11, 2021. Exposures: Rare variants identified in a panel of 145 genes that are included on cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia panels used by commercial clinical genetic testing laboratories. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequencing data were analyzed using an automated process followed by manual review by a panel of independent, blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was classification of rare variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria: benign, likely benign, variant of undetermined significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Disease-associated variants were defined as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant disorders. Results: Among 1293 participants (934 [72.2%] male; median [interquartile range] age at enrollment, 56 [48-61] years; median [interquartile range] age at AF diagnosis, 50 [41-56] years), genetic testing identified 131 participants (10.1%) with a disease-associated variant, 812 (62.8%) with a variant of undetermined significance, 92 (7.1%) as heterozygous carriers for an autosomal recessive disorder, and 258 (20.0%) with no suspicious variant. The likelihood of a disease-associated variant was highest in participants with AF diagnosed before the age of 30 years (20 of 119 [16.8%; 95% CI, 10.0%-23.6%]) and lowest after the age of 60 years (8 of 112 [7.1%; 95% CI, 2.4%-11.9%]). Disease-associated variants were more often associated with inherited cardiomyopathy syndromes compared with inherited arrhythmias. The most common genes were TTN (n = 38), MYH7 (n = 18), MYH6 (n = 10), LMNA (n = 9), and KCNQ1 (n = 8). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, genetic testing identified a disease-associated variant in 10% of patients with early-onset AF (the percentage was higher if diagnosed before the age of 30 years and lower if diagnosed after the age of 60 years). Most pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants are in genes associated with cardiomyopathy.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was time to death and was adjudicated from medical records and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of disease-associated variants with risk of death after adjustment for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term of age at AF diagnosis and disease-associated variant status. Results Among 1293 participants (934 [72%] male; median age at enrollment, 56.0 years; IQR, 48.0-61.0 years), disease-associated (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) rare variants were found in 131 (10%). During a median follow-up of 9.9 years (IQR, 6.9-13.2 years), 219 participants (17%) died. In univariable analysis, disease-associated variants were associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1;P = .05); the association remained significant in multivariable modeling when adjusted for age at AF diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and an interaction term between disease-associated variant status and age at AF diagnosis. The interaction demonstrated that disease-associated variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with no disease-associated variant when AF was diagnosed at a younger age (P = .008 for interaction). Higher body mass index (per IQR: HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6;P < .001) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (per IQR: HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8;P < .001) were associated with higher mortality risk. There were 73 cardiomyopathy-related deaths, 40 sudden deaths, and 10 stroke-related deaths. Mortality among patients with the most prevalent genes with disease-associated variants was 26% (10 of 38 patients) forTTN, 33% (6 of 18) forMYH7, 22% (2 of 9) forLMNA, 0% (0 of 10) forMYH6, and 0% (0 of 8) forKCNQ1.

  {"id":"Yousuf2015","abstract":"Despite the revolutionary advancements in the past 3 decades in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with device-based therapy, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an enormous public health burden. Survivors of SCD are generally at high risk for recurrent events. The clinical management of such patients requires a multidisciplinary approach from postresuscitative care to a thorough cardiovascular investigation in an attempt to identify the underlying substrate, with potential to eliminate or modify the triggers through catheter ablation and ultimately an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for prompt treatment of recurrences in those at risk. Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs. The lack of efficacy and the proarrhythmic effects of drugs catalyzed the development and investigation of the ICD through several major clinical trials that proved the efficacy of ICD as a bedrock tool to detect and promptly treat life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD therapy is routinely used for primary prevention of SCD in patients with cardiomyopathy and high risk inherited arrhythmic conditions and secondary prevention in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. This compendium will review the clinical management of those surviving SCD and discuss landmark studies of antiarrhythmic drugs, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yousuf","given":"Omair"},{"family":"Chrispin","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Tomaselli","given":"Gordon F."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Ronald D."}],"citation-key":"Yousuf2015","container-title":"Circulation Research","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304555","ISBN":"0009-7330","ISSN":"15244571","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,5]]},"page":"2020-2040","PMID":"26044254","title":"Clinical Management and Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304555","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"Yu2013","abstract":"Both the prevalence and incidence of heart failure (HF) are increasing, especially among African Americans, but no large-scale, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HF-related metabolites has been reported. We sought to identify novel genetic variants that are associated with metabolites previously reported to relate to HF incidence. GWASs of three metabolites identified previously as risk factors for incident HF (pyroglutamine, dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid, and X-11787, being either hydroxy-leucine or hydroxy-isoleucine) were performed in 1,260 African Americans free of HF at the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A significant association on chromosome 5q33 (rs10463316, MAF = 0.358, P-value = 1.92 × 10(-10) ) was identified for pyroglutamine. One region on chromosome 2p13 contained a nonsynonymous substitution in N-acetyltransferase 8 (NAT8) was associated with X-11787 (rs13538, MAF = 0.481, P-value = 1.71 × 10(-23) ). The smallest P-value for dihydroxy docosatrienoic acid was rs4006531 on chromosome 8q24 (MAF = 0.400, P-value = 6.98 × 10(-7) ). None of the above SNPs were individually associated with incident HF, but a genetic risk score (GRS) created by summing the most significant risk alleles from each metabolite detected 11% greater risk of HF per allele. In summary, we identified three loci associated with previously reported HF-related metabolites. Further use of metabolomics technology will facilitate replication of these findings in independent samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Danny"},{"family":"Manolio","given":"Teri A."},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Nettleton","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Boerwinkle","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"Yu2013","container-title":"Genetic Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1002/gepi.21752","ISBN":"1098-2272 (Electronic)\\r0741-0395 (Linking)","ISSN":"07410395","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,1]]},"page":"840-845","PMID":"23934736","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","title":"Genome-Wide association study of a heart failure related metabolomic profile among african americans in the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/gepi.21752","volume":"37"},

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2·87 for current vs never, PAR 35·7% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3·25 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49·2% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1·91, PAR 17·9%), diabetes (2·37, PAR 9·9%), abdominal obesity (1·12 for top vs lowest tertile and 1·62 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20·1% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2·67, PAR 32·5%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0·70, PAR 13·7% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0·91, PAR 6·7%), and regular physical activity (0·86, PAR 12·2%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0·0001 for all risk factors and p=0·03 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yusuf","given":"Prof Salim"},{"family":"Hawken","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Ôunpuu","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Dans","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Avezum","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Lanas","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"McQueen","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Budaj","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Pais","given":"Prem"},{"family":"Varigos","given":"John"},{"family":"Lisheng","given":"Liu"}],"citation-key":"Yusuf2004","container-title":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17018-9","ISSN":"01406736","issue":"9438","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",9,11]]},"page":"937-952","PMID":"15364185","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with myocardial infarction in 52 countries (the INTERHEART study): Case-control study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140673604170189/fulltext","volume":"364"},
  {"id":"Zaglia2013","abstract":"AIMS: Increased cardiac sympathetic neuron (SN) activity has been associated with pathologies such as heart failure and hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac innervation regulates cardiomyocyte trophism. Whether continuous input from the SNs is required for the maintenance of the cardiomyocyte size has not been determined thus far.\\n\\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To address the role of cardiac innervation in cardiomyocyte size regulation, we monitored the effect of pharmacological sympathetic denervation in mice on cardiac structure, function, and signalling from 24 h to 30 days in the absence of other pathological stimuli. SN ablation caused an immediate reduction in the cardiomyocyte size with minimal consequences on the resting contractile function. Atrophic remodelling was mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through FOXO-dependent early induction of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Atrogin-1/MAFbx and MuRF1, which was followed by activation of the autophagy-lysosome system. MuRF1 was found to be determinant in denervation atrophy as remodelling did not develop in denervated MuRF1 knock-out (KO) hearts. These effects were caused by decreased basal stimulation of cardiomyocyte β2-adrenoceptor (AR), as atrophy was prevented by treatment of denervated mice with the β2-AR agonist clenbuterol. Consistent with these data, we also observed that β2-AR KO mice showed cardiac atrophy at rest.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac SNs are strong regulators of the cardiomyocyte size via β2-AR-dependent repression of proteolysis, demonstrating that the neuro-cardiac axis operates constitutively for the determination of the physiological cardiomyocyte size. These results are of great clinical relevance given the role of β-AR in cardiovascular diseases and their modulation in therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zaglia","given":"Tania"},{"family":"Milan","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Franzoso","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Bertaggia","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Pianca","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Piasentini","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Voltarelli","given":"Vanessa A"},{"family":"Chiavegato","given":"David"},{"family":"Brum","given":"Patricia C"},{"family":"Glass","given":"David J"},{"family":"Schiaffino","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Sandri","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Mongillo","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"Zaglia2013","container-title":"Cardiovascular Research","DOI":"10.1093/cvr/cvs320","ISSN":"00086363","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"240-250","title":"Cardiac sympathetic neurons provide trophic signal to the heart via β2-adrenoceptor-dependent regulation of proteolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article-abstract/97/2/240/333642","volume":"97"},

However, evidence indicates that the neurogenic control of the heart spans from the maintenance of housekeeping functions in resting conditions to the recruitment of maximal performance, in the fight-or-flight responses, across a whole range of intermediate states.

  {"id":"Zamotrinsky2001a","abstract":"We tested the hypotheses that (1) progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases sympathetic inflow to the heart, thus impairing cardiac blood supply, and (2) reduced sympathetic tone improves cardiac microcirculation and ameliorates severity of anginal symptoms. Electrical irritation of the nerve auricularis-a sensitive ramus of the vagus nerve-provides a central sympatholytic action. Using this technique, we studied the effects of vagal neurostimulation (VNS) on hemodynamics, the content of atrial noradrenergic nerves and the microcirculatory bed of CAD patients. VNS was performed in the preoperative period of CAD patients with severe angina pectoris. The comparison groups consisted of untreated patients with CAD or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Atrial tissue of patients with this syndrome (n=6); with effort angina (n=14); with angina at rest (n=10); and with severe angina treated with VNS (n=8) contained the following volume percentages of noradrenergic nerves: 1.7±0.1%, 1.3±0.3%, 0.5±0.1% (p<0.05 vs. the other groups) and 1.3±0.2%, respectively. In these groups, cardiac microcirculatory vessels (diameter, 10-20 μm) had the following densities: 2.7±0.2%, 3.4±0.2%, 2.0±0.4% (p<0.05 vs. the other groups) and 3.3±0.3%, respectively. VNS treatment abolished angina at rest, decreased heart rate and blood pressure. It improved left ventricular ejection fraction from 50±1.5% to 58±1.0% (p<0.05), also changing left ventricular diastolic filling. The ratio of time velocity integrals of the early (Ei) to late (Ai) waves increased from 1.07±0.12 to 1.65±0.17 after VNS (p<0.05). In electrocardiograms of VNS-treated patients, QRS- and QT-duration were shortened, the PQ-interval did not change, but T-wave configuration improved. In the postoperative period, heart failure occurred in 90% of the control group, vs. 12% in patients treated with VNS (p<0.05). We conclude that CAD is characterized by overactivity of sympathetic cardiac tone. Vagal stimulation reduced sympathetic inflow to the heart, seemingly via an inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. VNS' sympatholytic/vagotonic action dilated cardiac microcirculatory vessels and improved left ventricular contractility in patients with severe CAD.

Yet, the direct association of HRV with cognitive function remains relatively unexplored, particularly in midlife. METHODS In 2005, 2 measures of short-term HRV, the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), were calculated for participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, and then categorized into quartiles. Five years later, 3 cognitive tests were administered for verbal memory (\"Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test\", RAVLT, range 0-15), processing speed (\"Digit Symbol Substitution Test\", DSST, range 0-133), and executive function (\"Stroop interference\"). RESULTS Two thousand one hundred and eighteen participants (57.7% female, 42.2% Black) with a mean baseline age of 45.3 years were included in this analysis. In demographic-adjusted models, compared to participants with quartile 1 SDNN (lowest quartile), participants in the upper quartiles of SDNN scored better on the DSST (quartile 4: β = 1.83 points better, P = 0.03; and quartile 3: β = 1.95 points better, P = 0.03) and on the stroop (quartile 3: β = 1.19 points better, P < 0.05; and quartile2: β = 1.44 points better, P = 0.02). After adjusting for behavioral and cardiovascular risk factors, higher quartile SDNN remained significantly associated with better stroop score (quartile 3: β = 1.21 points better, P = 0.04; and quartile 2: β = 1.72 points better, P < 0.01) but not with DSST. There was no association between quartile of RMSSD and cognitive function, from fully adjusted models.

Recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to AD susceptibility, including those in the CLU and BIN1 genes encoding for clusterin (CLU) and the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) proteins, respectively. Because CLU has been implicated in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance in mouse models of amyloid deposition, we sought to investigate whether an AD-linked SNP in the CLU gene altered Aβ42 biomarker levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, we found that the CLU rs11136000 SNP modified CSF levels of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in AD patients. We also found that an intracellular form of CLU (iCLU) was upregulated in the brain of Tau overexpressing Tg4510 mice, but not in Tg2576 amyloid mouse model. By overexpressing iCLU and Tau in cell culture systems we discovered that iCLU was a Tau-interacting protein and that iCLU associated with brain-specific isoforms of BIN1, also recently identified as a Tau-binding protein. Through expression analysis of CLU and BIN1 variants, we found that CLU and BIN1 interacted via their coiled-coil motifs. In co-immunoprecipitation studies using human brain tissue, we showed that iCLU and the major BIN1 isoform expressed in neurons were associated with modified Tau species found in AD. Finally, we showed that expression of certain coding CLU variants linked to AD risk led to increased levels of iCLU. Together, our findings suggest that iCLU and BIN1 interaction might impact Tau function in neurons and uncover potential new mechanisms underlying the etiology of Tau pathology in AD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Ikuo"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Jacky"},{"family":"Tugusheva","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Renger","given":"John J."},{"family":"Zerbinatti","given":"Celina"}],"citation-key":"Zhou2014","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0103187","editor":[{"family":"Götz","given":"Jürgen"}],"ISBN":"1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking)","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,22]]},"page":"e103187","PMID":"25051234","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Intracellular clusterin interacts with brain isoforms of the bridging integrator 1 and with the microtubule-associated protein Tau in Alzheimer's Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103187","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Zhou2017","abstract":"Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) presents as an encephalopathy without central nervous system infection or tumor. HE is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis and is thus considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of HE is low, but death and status epilepticus have been reported. HE manifests with a wide range of symptoms that include behavioral changes and confusion. Elevated thyroid antibodies are present in the majority of cases and are required for the diagnosis of HE. Normal brain MRI findings are found in the majority of patients diagnosed with HE. The most consistent CSF abnormality noted in HE patients is the presence of elevated protein. Most HE patients respond well to steroid therapy. Clinical improvements are also observed with IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. In conclusion, it is now generally accepted that the diagnosis of HE must include encephalopathy characterized by cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric features, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Autoimmune encephalitis and prion disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical features of these conditions to those of HE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"J.

  {"id":"Zhu2019","abstract":"Autonomic dysregulation in cardiovascular disease plays a major role in the pathogenesis of arrhythmias. Cardiac neural control relies on complex feedback loops consisting of efferent and afferent limbs, which carry sympathetic and parasympathetic signals from the brain to the heart and sensory signals from the heart to the brain. Cardiac disease leads to neural remodeling and sympathovagal imbalances with arrhythmogenic effects. Preclinical studies of modulation at central and peripheral levels of the cardiac autonomic nervous system have yielded promising results, leading to early stage clinical studies of these techniques in atrial fibrillation and refractory ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes and structural heart disease. However, significant knowledge gaps in basic cardiac neurophysiology limit the success of these neuromodulatory therapies. This review discusses the recent advances in neuromodulation for cardiac arrhythmia management, with a clinical scenario-based approach aimed at bringing neurocardiology closer to the realm of the clinical electrophysiologist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"C."},{"family":"Hanna","given":"P."},{"family":"Rajendran","given":"Pradeep S."},{"family":"Shivkumar","given":"Kalyanam"}],"citation-key":"Zhu2019","container-title":"JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jacep.2019.06.009","ISSN":"2405500X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"page":"881-896","PMID":"31439288","publisher":"Elsevier Inc","title":"Neuromodulation for Ventricular Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation: A Clinical Scenario-Based Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC6773263/?report=abstract","volume":"5"},

First, we present data indicating the functional importance of presynaptic and postsynaptic vagal modulation of adrenergic neurotransmission on electrical activity in sinus and A-V nodes, and contractile activity of canine cardiac Purkinje fibers. Second, we indicate the possible intraventricular adrenergic and vagal pathways to the ventricles, suggesting that sympathetic fibers travel in the epicardium while vagal fibers appear to cross the A-V groove in the epicardium but then take an intramural route for part of their course. Finally, we demonstrate that a lesion such as a myocardial infarction can interrupt neural fibers traveling through the infarction to affect noninfarcted myocardium distal to the infarction. These factors may play a role in the genesis of some cardiac arrhythmias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"ZIPES","given":"DOUGLAS P."},{"family":"BARBER","given":"MICHAEL J."},{"family":"TAKAHASHI","given":"NOBUHIRO"},{"family":"GILMOUR","given":"ROBERT F."}],"citation-key":"ZIPES1983","container-title":"Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-8159.1983.tb04459.x","ISBN":"0147-8389 (Print)\\r0147-8389 (Linking)","ISSN":"15408159","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",9,1]]},"page":"1210-1220","PMID":"6195641","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd (10.1111)","title":"Influence of the Autonomic Nervous System on the Genesis of Cardiac Arrhythmias","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1540-8159.1983.tb04459.x","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Zipes1990","abstract":"he vagus and sympathetic nerves link the heart to the central nervous system, carrying information from the heart over neural afferents and to the heart over neural efferents. Although it is generally well accepted that the autonomic nervous system can promote, precipitate, or prevent the development of cardiac arrhythmias, the mechanisms by which this transpires are incompletely understood. Several excellent recent reviews provide an overall discussion of the role of the autonomic nervous system and the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias.12 This review will focus on selected recent observations concerning autonomic innervation of the heart, the effects of myocardial ischemia and infarction on such innervation, and how some of these changes can modulate the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Autonomic Innervation of Heart Extracardiac Nerves Numerous studies to determine extracardiac neu-ral innervation to the heart reveal that although significant overlap and complex patterns exist, in general autonomic neural input to the heart exhibits some degree of \"sidedness.\" The right sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the sinus node more than the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the left sympathetic and vagus nerves affect the AV node more than the sinus node. Precise points of entry of parasympathetic nerves to the sinus and AV nodal regions have recently been described.3 On the right, vagal input to the superior atrial and sinus nodal regions is by neural projections along the superior vena cava-right atrial junction, azygos vein, right pulmonary vein complex, and dorsal surfaces of the common pulmonary vein complex.

  {"id":"Zipes1997","abstract":"Background: Patients who survive life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are at risk for recurrent arrhythmias. They can be treated with either an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or antiarrhythmic drugs, but the relative efficacy of these two treatment strategies is unknown. Methods: To address this issue, we conducted a randomized comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients who had been resuscitated from near-fatal ventricular fibrillation or who had undergone cardioversion from sustained ventricular tachycardia. Patients with ventricular tachycardia also had either syncope or other serious cardiac symptoms, along with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 or less. One group of patients was treated with implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator; the other received class III antiarrhythmic drugs, primarily amiodarone at empirically determined doses. Fifty-six clinical centers screened all patients who presented with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during a period of nearly four years. Of 1016 patients (45 percent of whom had ventricular fibrillation, and 55 percent ventricular tachycardia), 507 were randomly assigned to treatment with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and 509 to antiarrhythmic-drug therapy. The primary end point was overall mortality. Results: Follow-up was complete for 1013 patients (99.7 percent). Overall survival was greater with the implantable defibrillator, with unadjusted estimates of 89.3 percent, as compared with 82.3 percent in the antiarrhythmic-drug group at one year, 81.6 perCent versus 74.7 percent at two years, and 75.4 percent versus 64.1 percent at three years (P<0.02). The corresponding reductions in mortality (with 95 percent confidence limits) with the implantable defibrillator were 39±20 percent, 27±21 percent, and 31±21 percent. Conclusions: Among survivors of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia causing severe symptoms, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is superior to antiarrhythmic drugs for increasing overall survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglas P.
